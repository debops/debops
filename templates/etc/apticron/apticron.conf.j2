# enumerates all configured network addresses on all configured network inter‐
# faces, and translates them to DNS domain names. Addresses that cannot be
# translated (i.e. because they do not have an appro‐ priate  reverse DNS
# entry) are skipped. Note that different addresses may resolve to the same
# name, therefore the output may contain duplicate entries. Do not make any
# assumptions about the order of the output."

# of "hostname -f" for the system name in the mails it generates. This option
# overrides the ALL_FQDNS above.

# addresses apticron displays. The default is to display 1 address of each
# family type (inet, inet6), if available.

# are not installed in your system. Yes, it's possible! There are some issues
# related to systems which have mixed stable/unstable sources. In these cases
# apt-get will consider for example that packages with "Priority:
# required"/"Essential: yes" in unstable but not in stable should be installed,
# so they will be listed in dist-upgrade output. Please take a look at
