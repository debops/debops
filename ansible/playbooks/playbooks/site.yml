# This is main entry point for DebOps playbooks. By default 'debops' script
# accesses this playbook; with command line arguments you can access
# sub-playbooks separately for a lighter ansible-playbook run, if needed.


  # This playbook contains roles that are run on all hosts in the inventory
  # - common services like SMTP server, administrative tasks, authentication
  # and authorization control, system services used by other applications like
  # firewall, etc.
- include: common.yml

  # This playbook manages internal system plumbing expected on the host by
  # services, like user accounts, NFS mounts from remote hosts, and so on.
  # Everything that is not common, but enabled on a per group/host basis.
- include: sys.yml

  # This playbook manages different programming language environments available
  # on each host, enabled using Ansible groups.
- include: env.yml

  # This playbook manages network infrastructure, like creation and management
  # of separate subnets, DNS, DHCP services, routing configuration, etc.
- include: net.yml

  # This playbook manages system services enabled using Ansible groups, like
  # databases, webservers, application servers, and so on.
- include: srv.yml

  # This playbook contains plays which install and manage more complex
  # applications which can use multiple services at a time, or are user-facing
  # applications like webservices.
- include: app.yml

  # This playbook manages virtualized environments installed on hosts, like
  # OpenVZ Hardware Nodes, support for LXC containers in a host, or support for
  # KVM virtual machines. This is meant for the host-side of the virtualization
  # support, guest-side is managed by the rest of the playbook without the use
  # of the plays contained here.
- include: virt.yml

  # This playbook manages hardware-related roles - device management, disk
  # partitioning, hardware monitoring, kernel management, any roles that would
  # require a reboot.
- include: hw.yml
