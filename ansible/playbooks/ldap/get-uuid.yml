# DebOps uses the "to_uuid" Ansible filter to convert LDAP Distinguished Names
# to UUID strings that are safe to use in shell and store in the filesystem.
# This playbook can be used to convert Distinguished Names to UUID strings to
# help locate specific data about a particular Distinguished Name, for example
# a password stored in the 'secret/ldap/credentials/' directory or in the
# 'pass' database.
#
# To use this playbook, it is best to apply it against a specifc host that is
# configured to use LDAP via the 'debops.ldap' Ansible role. If that's not the
# case, the playbook will still work, however the resulting UUIDs might not be
# correct.
#
# Remember to specify Distinguished Name attributes separated by commas,
# without spaces between them. For example, don't use:
#
#     uid=user, ou=People, dc=example, dc=org
#
# Specify the DN as:
#
#     uid=user,ou=People,dc=example,dc=org
#
# Usage: debops ldap/get-uuid -l ldap-host
