# This playbook can be used to bootstrap freshly installed minimal Debian
# system for Ansible management. The expected state the host:
#   - host is already configured in Ansible inventory/hosts file;
#   - local user has prepared SSH keypair in RSA format;
#   - host has OpenSSH server installed;
#
# Modifications that will be made on the host:
#   - playbook will install Python support with some essential software;
#   - a system 'admins' group will be created for users who have administrator
#     privileges (full sudo permissions);
#   - a system administrator account will be created and added to the 'admins'
#     group; If you are connecting directly as root, this account will be named
#     after your local user account, otherwise it will be named after the user
#     you are connecting as (option `-u` or ansible_ssh_user from some config- or
#     inventory-file).
#   - no passwords are set or modified on any account;
#   - if set, playbook will configure hostname and domain on the host using
#     'inventory_hostname' and 'bootstrap_domain' variables;
#
# Usage:
# To connect directly as root, run:
#
#     debops bootstrap -u root -k --limit host
#
# To connect as normal user and switch to sudo, run:
#
#     debops bootstrap --become --limit host
