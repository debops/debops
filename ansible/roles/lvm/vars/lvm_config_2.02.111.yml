  # This section allows you to configure which block devices should
  # be used by the LVM system.
  devices:

    # Where do you want your volume groups to appear ?
    dir: "/dev"

    # An array of directories that contain the device nodes you wish
    # to use with LVM2.
    scan: [ "/dev" ]

    # If set, the cache of block device nodes with all associated symlinks
    # will be constructed out of the existing udev database content.
    # This avoids using and opening any inapplicable non-block devices or
    # subdirectories found in the device directory. This setting is applied
    # to udev-managed device directory only, other directories will be scanned
    # fully. LVM2 needs to be compiled with udev support for this setting to
    # take effect. N.B. Any device node or symlink not managed by udev in
    # udev directory will be ignored with this setting on.
    obtain_device_list_from_udev: 1

    # If several entries in the scanned directories correspond to the
    # same block device and the tools need to display a name for device,
    # all the pathnames are matched against each item in the following
    # list of regular expressions in turn and the first match is used.

    # By default no preferred names are defined.
    # preferred_names: [ ]

    # Try to avoid using undescriptive /dev/dm-N names, if present.
    # preferred_names: [ "^/dev/mpath/", "^/dev/mapper/mpath", "^/dev/[hs]d" ]

    # In case no prefererred name matches or if preferred_names are not
    # defined at all, builtin rules are used to determine the preference.
    #
    # The first builtin rule checks path prefixes and it gives preference
    # based on this ordering (where "dev" depends on devices/dev setting):
    #   /dev/mapper > /dev/disk > /dev/dm-* > /dev/block
    #
    # If the ordering above cannot be applied, the path with fewer slashes
    # gets preference then.
    #
    # If the number of slashes is the same, a symlink gets preference.
    #
    # Finally, if all the rules mentioned above are not applicable,
    # lexicographical order is used over paths and the smallest one
    # of all gets preference.


    # A filter that tells LVM2 to only use a restricted set of devices.
    # The filter consists of an array of regular expressions.  These
    # expressions can be delimited by a character of your choice, and
    # prefixed with either an 'a' (for accept) or 'r' (for reject).
    # The first expression found to match a device name determines if
    # the device will be accepted or rejected (ignored).  Devices that
    # don't match any patterns are accepted.

    # Be careful if there there are symbolic links or multiple filesystem
    # entries for the same device as each name is checked separately against
    # the list of patterns.  The effect is that if the first pattern in the
    # list to match a name is an 'a' pattern for any of the names, the device
    # is accepted; otherwise if the first pattern in the list to match a name
    # is an 'r' pattern for any of the names it is rejected; otherwise it is
    # accepted.

    # Don't have more than one filter line active at once: only one gets used.

    # Run vgscan after you change this parameter to ensure that
    # the cache file gets regenerated (see below).
    # If it doesn't do what you expect, check the output of 'vgscan -vvvv'.

    # If lvmetad is used, then see "A note about device filtering while
    # lvmetad is used" comment that is attached to global/use_lvmetad setting.

    # By default we accept every block device:
    # filter: [ "a/.*/" ]

    # Exclude the cdrom drive
    # filter: [ "r|/dev/cdrom|" ]

    # When testing I like to work with just loopback devices:
    # filter: [ "a/loop/", "r/.*/" ]

    # Or maybe all loops and ide drives except hdc:
    # filter: [ "a|loop|", "r|/dev/hdc|", "a|/dev/ide|", "r|.*|" ]

    # Use anchors if you want to be really specific
    # filter: [ "a|^/dev/hda8$|", "r/.*/" ]

    # Since "filter" is often overridden from command line, it is not suitable
    # for system-wide device filtering (udev rules, lvmetad). To hide devices
    # from LVM-specific udev processing and/or from lvmetad, you need to set
    # global_filter. The syntax is the same as for normal "filter"
    # above. Devices that fail the global_filter are not even opened by LVM.

    # The results of the filtering are cached on disk to avoid
    # rescanning dud devices (which can take a very long time).

    # in a file called '.cache'.
    # It is safe to delete the contents: the tools regenerate it.
    # (The old setting 'cache' is still respected if neither of
    # these new ones is present.)

    # file is removed.

    # ignore_lvm_mirrors:  Introduced in version 2.02.104
    # This setting determines whether logical volumes of "mirror" segment
    # type are scanned for LVM labels.  This affects the ability of
    # mirrors to be used as physical volumes.  If 'ignore_lvm_mirrors'
    # is set to '1', it becomes impossible to create volume groups on top
    # of mirror logical volumes - i.e. to stack volume groups on mirrors.
    #
    # Allowing mirror logical volumes to be scanned (setting the value to '0')
    # can potentially cause LVM processes and I/O to the mirror to become
    # blocked.  This is due to the way that the "mirror" segment type handles
    # failures.  In order for the hang to manifest itself, an LVM command must
    # be run just after a failure and before the automatic LVM repair process
    # takes place OR there must be failures in multiple mirrors in the same
    # volume group at the same time with write failures occurring moments
    # before a scan of the mirror's labels.
    #
    # Note that these scanning limitations do not apply to the LVM RAID
    # types, like "raid1".  The RAID segment types handle failures in a
    # different way and are not subject to possible process or I/O blocking.
    #
    # It is encouraged that users set 'ignore_lvm_mirrors' to 1 if they
    # are using the "mirror" segment type.  Users that require volume group
    # stacking on mirrored logical volumes should consider using the "raid1"

    # 'mirror_segtype_default' defines which segtype will be used when the

    #
    # "mirror" - The original RAID1 implementation provided by LVM2/DM.  It is
    #	         characterized by a flexible log solution (core, disk, mirrored)
    #		 and by the necessity to block I/O while reconfiguring in the
    #		 event of a failure.
    #
    #		 There is an inherent race in the dmeventd failure handling
    #		 logic with snapshots of devices using this type of RAID1 that
    #		 in the worst case could cause a deadlock.
    #		   Ref: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=817130#c10
    #
    # "raid1"  - This implementation leverages MD's RAID1 personality through
    #		 device-mapper.  It is characterized by a lack of log options.
    #		 (A log is always allocated for every device and they are placed
    #		 on the same device as the image - no separate devices are
    #		 required.)  This mirror implementation does not require I/O
    #		 to be blocked in the kernel in the event of a failure.
    #		 This mirror implementation is not cluster-aware and cannot be
    #		 used in a shared (active/active) fashion in a cluster.

    # setting.

    # 'raid10_segtype_default' determines the segment types used by default

    # Possible settings include:
    #
    # "raid10" - This implementation leverages MD's RAID10 personality through
    #            device-mapper.
    #
    # "mirror" - LVM will layer the 'mirror' and 'stripe' segment types.  It
    #            will do this by creating a mirror on top of striped sub-LVs;
    #            effectively creating a RAID 0+1 array.  This is suboptimal

    # Whether to use (trust) a running instance of lvmetad. If this is set to
    # 0, all commands fall back to the usual scanning mechanisms. When set to 1
    # *and* when lvmetad is running (automatically instantiated by making use of
    # systemd's socket-based service activation or run as an initscripts service
    # or run manually), the volume group metadata and PV state flags are obtained
    # from the lvmetad instance and no scanning is done by the individual
    # commands. In a setup with lvmetad, lvmetad udev rules *must* be set up for
    # LVM to work correctly. Without proper udev rules, all changes in block
    # device configuration will be *ignored* until a manual 'pvscan --cache'
    # is performed. These rules are installed by default.
    #
    # If lvmetad has been running while use_lvmetad was 0, it MUST be stopped
    # before changing use_lvmetad to 1 and started again afterwards.
    #
    # If using lvmetad, the volume activation is also switched to automatic
    # event-based mode. In this mode, the volumes are activated based on
    # incoming udev events that automatically inform lvmetad about new PVs
    # that appear in the system. Once the VG is complete (all the PVs are
    # present), it is auto-activated. The activation/auto_activation_volume_list
    # setting controls which volumes are auto-activated (all by default).
    #
    # A note about device filtering while lvmetad is used:
    # When lvmetad is updated (either automatically based on udev events
    # or directly by pvscan --cache <device> call), the devices/filter
    # is ignored and all devices are scanned by default. The lvmetad always
    # keeps unfiltered information which is then provided to LVM commands
    # and then each LVM command does the filtering based on devices/filter
    # setting itself.
    # To prevent scanning devices completely, even when using lvmetad,
    # the devices/global_filter must be used.
    # N.B. Don't use lvmetad with locking type 3 as lvmetad is not yet
    # supported in clustered environment. If use_lvmetad=1 and locking_type=3
    # is set at the same time, LVM always issues a warning message about this
    # and then it automatically disables lvmetad use.

    #		  logical volume has failed.  It is left to the user to run
    #		  'lvconvert --repair' manually to remove or replace the failed
    #		  device.  As long as the number of failed devices does not
    #		  exceed the redundancy of the logical volume (1 device for
    #		  raid4/5, 2 for raid6, etc) the logical volume will remain
    #		  usable.

    # 'mirror_image_fault_policy' and 'mirror_log_fault_policy' define
    # how a device failure affecting a mirror (of "mirror" segment type) is
    # handled.  A mirror is composed of mirror images (copies) and a log.
    # A disk log ensures that a mirror does not need to be re-synced
    # (all copies made the same) every time a machine reboots or crashes.
    #
    # In the event of a failure, the specified policy will be used to determine
    # what happens. This applies to automatic repairs (when the mirror is being
    # monitored by dmeventd) and to manual lvconvert --repair when
    # --use-policies is given.
    #
    # "remove" - Simply remove the faulty device and run without it.  If
    #            the log device fails, the mirror would convert to using
    #            an in-memory log.  This means the mirror will not
    #            remember its sync status across crashes/reboots and
    #            the entire mirror will be re-synced.  If a
    #            mirror image fails, the mirror will convert to a
    #            non-mirrored device if there is only one remaining good
    #            copy.
    #
    # "allocate" - Remove the faulty device and try to allocate space on
    #            a new device to be a replacement for the failed device.
    #            Using this policy for the log is fast and maintains the
    #            ability to remember sync state through crashes/reboots.
    #            Using this policy for a mirror device is slow, as it
    #            requires the mirror to resynchronize the devices, but it
    #            will preserve the mirror characteristic of the device.
    #            This policy acts like "remove" if no suitable device and
    #            space can be allocated for the replacement.
    #
    # "allocate_anywhere" - Not yet implemented. Useful to place the log device
    #            temporarily on same physical volume as one of the mirror
    #            images. This policy is not recommended for mirror devices
    #            since it would break the redundant nature of the mirror. This
    #            policy acts like "remove" if no suitable device and space can

  # Metadata settings
  #
  # metadata:
    # Default number of copies of metadata to hold on each PV.  0, 1 or 2.
    # You might want to override it from the command line with 0
    # when running pvcreate on new PVs which are to be added to large VGs.

    # pvmetadatacopies: 1

    # Default number of copies of metadata to maintain for each VG.
    # If set to a non-zero value, LVM automatically chooses which of
    # the available metadata areas to use to achieve the requested
    # number of copies of the VG metadata.  If you set a value larger
    # than the the total number of metadata areas available then
    # metadata is stored in them all.
    # The default value of 0 ("unmanaged") disables this automatic
    # management and allows you to control which metadata areas
    # are used at the individual PV level using 'pvchange
    # --metadataignore y/n'.

    # vgmetadatacopies: 0

    # Approximate default size of on-disk metadata areas in sectors.
    # You should increase this if you have large volume groups or
    # you want to retain a large on-disk history of your metadata changes.

    # pvmetadatasize: 255

    # List of directories holding live copies of text format metadata.
    # These directories must not be on logical volumes!
    # It's possible to use LVM2 with a couple of directories here,
    # preferably on different (non-LV) filesystems, and with no other
    # on-disk metadata (pvmetadatacopies = 0). Or this can be in
    # addition to on-disk metadata areas.
    # The feature was originally added to simplify testing and is not
    # supported under low memory situations - the machine could lock up.
    #
    # Never edit any files in these directories by hand unless you
    # you are absolutely sure you know what you are doing! Use
    # the supplied toolset to make changes (e.g. vgcfgrestore).
