# The following expression specifies the files not to be archived.
# See the find(1) man page for further info. It is discouraged to
# use anything different from conditions (e. g. actions) as it may have
# unforeseeable side effects.

# This example skips all files and directories with a path name containing
# '.nobackup' and all .o files:
SKIPCOND=( {{ backup2l__skipcond }} )

# Some background on 'SKIPCOND': The method of using a find(1) expression to determine
# files to backup or to skip is very powerful. Some of the following examples result from feature
# requests by various users who were not always aware that their "feature" was already implemented. ;-)
#
# If you want to exclude several directories use the following expression:
#   SKIPCOND=(-path '/path1' -o -path '/path1/*' -o -path '/path2' -o -path '/path2/*')
#
# If you do not have anything to skip, use:
#   SKIPCOND=(-false)     # "SKIPCOND=()" does not work
#
# To skip directory trees (for performance reasons) you can add the '-prune' action to your SKIPCOND setting, e.g.:
#   SKIPCOND=( -name "unimportant_dir" -prune )
#
# To prevent backup2l from crossing filesystem boundaries you can add '-xdev' or '-mount' to your SKIPCOND setting.
