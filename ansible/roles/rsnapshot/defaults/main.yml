      Same as "verbose" above, but controls the amount of data sent to the

      If you want the rsync output, you have to set it to 4

      If enabled, rsnapshot will write a lockfile to prevent two instances
      from running simultaneously (and messing up the snapshot_root).
      If you enable this, make sure the lockfile directory is not world
      writable. Otherwise anyone can prevent the program from running.

      By default, rsnapshot check lockfile, check if PID is running

      Default arguments for the "du" program (for disk space reporting).
      The GNU version of "du" is preferred. See the man page for more details.
      If your version of "du" does not support the -h flag, try -k flag instead.

      If this is enabled, rsync will not span filesystem partitions within a

      The include and exclude parameters, if enabled, simply get passed directly

      rsync man page for more details on how to specify file name patterns.

      If your version of rsync supports --link-dest, consider enabling this.
      This is the best way to support special files (FIFOs, etc) cross-platform.

    comment: |
      When sync_first is enabled, it changes the default behaviour of rsnapshot.
      Normally, when rsnapshot is called with its lowest interval
      (i.e.: "rsnapshot alpha"), it will sync files AND rotate the lowest
      intervals. With sync_first enabled, "rsnapshot sync" handles the file sync,
      and all interval calls simply rotate files. See the man page for more
      details. The default is 0 (off).

      If enabled, rsnapshot will move the oldest directory for each interval
      to [interval_name].delete, then it will remove the lockfile and delete
      that directory just before it exits. The default is 0 (off).

      Number of rsync re-tries. If you experience any network problems or

      "Corrupted MAC on input", for example, set this to a non-zero value
