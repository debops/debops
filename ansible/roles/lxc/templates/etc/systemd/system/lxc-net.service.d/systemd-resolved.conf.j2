# Automatically add/remove internal LXC domain in system resolver using
# 'systemd-resolved' service

[Unit]

# By default 'lxc-net.service' on Debian depends on network-online.target,
# which doesn't work correctly (see: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/209832/).
#
# Add a dependency on 'network.target' so that lxc-net at least is configured
# after ferm.service and sets up its networking as expected.
After=network.target

[Service]

# Automatically add / remove LXC subdomain in systemd-resolved. With usable
# local DNS resolver this allows to access the LXC containers from the LXC host
# via their names instead of their IP addresses.
ExecStart=/usr/local/lib/lxc/lxc-net-systemd-resolved start
ExecStop=/usr/local/lib/lxc/lxc-net-systemd-resolved stop
