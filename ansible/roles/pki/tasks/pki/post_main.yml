# You can have your own tasks run before and after the pki role
# by creating a tasks/pki/pre_main.yml relative to your playbook.
# To make debops find these, place something like following in
# your .debops.cfg:
#   [paths]
#   template-paths: ansible/templates
#   task-paths: ansible/tasks/
#   file-paths: ansible/files/
