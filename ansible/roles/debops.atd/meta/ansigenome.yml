  synopsis: |
    The `at` and `batch` commands can be used to compliment `cron` and run
    one-off tasks either at a specified time, or when the host CPU utilization is
    on a low enough level.

    The `debops.atd` role can be used to configure the `atd` service, including
    randomized load average threshold and randomized time between batch job
    execution, as well as access control to the `at` and `batch` commands by
    the users.
