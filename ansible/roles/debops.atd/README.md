The `at` and `batch` commands can be used to compliment `cron` and run
one-off tasks either at a specified time, or when the host CPU utilization is
on a low enough level.

The `debops.atd` role can be used to configure the `atd` service, including
randomized load average threshold and randomized time between batch job
execution, as well as access control to the `at` and `batch` commands by
the users.
