# This is a configuration file for apt-cacher-ng, a smart caching proxy for
# software package downloads. It's supposed to be in a directory specified by
# the -c option of apt-cacher-ng, see apt-cacher-ng(8) for details.
# RULES:
# - letter case in variable names does not matter
# - names and values are separated by colon or equals sign
# - for boolean variables, zero means false, non-zero means true
# - "default value" means built-in (!) defaults, i.e. something which the
#   program uses if the option is not set here or in other config files.
#   That value might be explicitly mentioned in the description. Where it is
#   not, there is no reason to assume any of the examples to be the default
#   value! In doubt, use acngtool to query the value of the particular variable.

# Storage directory for downloaded data and related maintenance activity.
#
# Note: When the value for CacheDir is changed, change the file
# /lib/systemd/system/apt-cacher-ng.service too

# Addresses or hostnames to listen on. Multiple addresses must be separated by
# spaces. Each entry must be an exact local address which is associated with a
# local interface. DNS resolution is performed using getaddrinfo(3) for all
# available protocols (IPv4, IPv6, ...). Using a protocol specific format will
# create binding(s) only on protocol specific socket(s), e.g. 0.0.0.0 will
# listen only to IPv4. The endpoint can also be specified as host:port (or
# [ipv6-address]:port) which allows binding on non-standard ports (Port

# DlMaxRetries: 2

# Pigeonholing files (like static vs. volatile contents) is done by (extended)
# regular expressions.
#
# The following patterns are available for the purposes detailed, where
# the latter takes precedence over the former:
# - «PFilePattern» for static data that doesn't change silently on the server.
# - «VFilePattern» for volatile data that may change like every hour. Files
#   that match both PFilePattern and VfilePattern will be treated as volatile.
# - Static data with file names that match VFilePattern may be overriden being
#   treated as volatile by making it match the special static data pattern,
#   «SPfilePattern».
# - «SVfilePattern» or the "special volatile data" pattern is for the
#   convenience of specifying any exceptions to matches with SPfilePattern,
#   for cases where data must still be treated as volatile.
# - «WfilePattern» specifies a "whitelist pattern" for the regular expiration
#   job, telling it to keep the files even if they are not referenced by
#   others, like crypto signatures with which clients begin their downloads.
#
# There are two versions. The pattern variables mentioned above should not be
# set without good reason, because they would override the built-in defaults
# (that might impact updates to future versions of apt-cacher-ng). There are
# also versions of those patterns ending with Ex, which may be modified by the
# local administrator. They are evaluated in addition to the regular patterns
# at runtime.

# APT when requesting a complete version of this file.
# The downside of this feature is higher CPU load on the server during
# the maintenance tasks, and the outcome might have not much value in a LAN
# where all clients update their data often and regularly and therefore usually
# don't need the full version of the index file.

#

# Sometimes it makes sense to not store the data in cache and just return the
# package data to client while it comes in. The following DontCache* parameters
# can enable this behaviour for certain URL types. The tokens are extended
# regular expressions which the URLs are evaluated against.
#
# DontCacheRequested is applied to the URL as it comes in from the client.
# Example: exclude packages built with kernel-package for x86
# DontCacheRequested: linux-.*_10\...\.Custo._i386
# Example usecase: exclude popular private IP ranges from caching
# DontCacheRequested: 192.168.0 ^10\..* 172.30
#
# DontCacheResolved is applied to URLs after mapping to the target server. If
# multiple backend servers are specified then it's only matched against the
# download link for the FIRST possible source (due to implementation limits).
#
# Example usecase: all Ubuntu stuff comes from a local mirror (specified as
# backend), don't cache it again:
# DontCacheResolved: ubuntumirror.local.net
#
# DontCache directive sets (overrides) both, DontCacheResolved and
# DontCacheRequested.  Provided for convenience, see those directives for

# If many machines from the same local network attempt to update index files

# specifies the length of this period before these (volatile) files are
# considered outdated.
# Setting this value too low transfers more data and increases remote server
# load, setting this too high (more than a couple of minutes) increases the
# risk of delivering inconsistent responses to the clients.
#
# FreshIndexMaxAge: 27

# Usually the users are not allowed to specify custom TCP ports of remote
# mirrors in the requests, only the default HTTP port can be used (as
# workaround, proxy administrator can create Remap- rules with custom ports).
# This restriction can be disabled by specifying a list of allowed ports or 0
# for any port.
#
# AllowUserPorts: 80

# Normally the HTTP redirection responses are forwarded to the original caller
# (i.e. APT) which starts a new download attempt from the new URL. This
# solution is ok for client configurations with proxy mode but doesn't work
# well with configurations using URL prefixes in sources.list. To work around
# this the server can restart its own download with a redirection URL,
# configured with the following option. The downside is that this might be used
# to circumvent download source policies by malicious users.
# The RedirMax option specifies how many such redirects the server is allowed
# to follow per request, 0 disables the internal redirection.
# Default: guessed on startup, 0 if ForceManaged is used and 5 otherwise.
#
# RedirMax: 5

# There some broken HTTP servers and proxy servers in the wild which don't
# support the If-Range header correctly and return incorrect data when the
# contents of a (volatile) file changed. Setting VfileUseRangeOps to zero
# disables Range-based requests while retrieving volatile files, using
# If-Modified-Since and requesting the complete file instead. Setting it to
# a negative value removes even If-Modified-Since headers.
#
# VfileUseRangeOps: 1

# Allow data pass-through mode for certain hosts when requested by the client
# using a CONNECT request. This is particularly useful to allow access to SSL
# sites (https proxying). The string is a regular expression which should cover
# the server name with port and must be correctly formated and terminated.
# Examples:
# PassThroughPattern: private-ppa\.launchpad\.net:443$
# PassThroughPattern: .* # this would allow CONNECT to everything
#
# Default: ^(bugs\.debian\.org|changelogs\.ubuntu\.com):443$
# PassThroughPattern: ^(bugs\.debian\.org|changelogs\.ubuntu\.com):443$

# It's possible that an evil client requests a volatile file but does not
# retrieve the response and keeps the connection effectively stuck over
# many hours, blocking the particular file for other download attempts (which
# leads to not reporting file changes on server side to other users). In such
