The `debops.etc_services` role can be used to "reserve" or "register" a
service port in the `/etc/services` file. Service ports configured this way can
appear as named entries in many command outputs, such as `iptables --list`
or `netstat --listening --program`. You can also have convenient database
of reserved and free ports on a particular host, and reference ports by
their names in firewall configuration files.

### Installation

This role requires at least Ansible `v2.0.0`. To install it, run:

```Shell
ansible-galaxy install debops.etc_services
```

### Documentation

More information about `debops.etc_services` can be found in the
[official debops.etc_services documentation](http://docs.debops.org/en/latest/ansible/roles/ansible-etc_services/docs/).



### Are you using this as a standalone role without DebOps?

You may need to include missing roles from the [DebOps common
playbook](https://github.com/debops/debops-playbooks/blob/master/playbooks/common.yml)
into your playbook.
