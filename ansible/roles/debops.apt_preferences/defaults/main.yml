# APT preference presets [[[
# --------------------------

# This section contains presets of APT preferences intended for advanced users
# who want to install software from different releases but want to keep there
# main system on the stable release.
#
# When enabling these presets, you will need to set explicit preferences for
# packages you want to install from different releases.
# Examples for such explicit preferences can be found in the
# `defaults file of the ypid.packages`_ (search for "Package origin presets for
# Debian GNU/Linux").
#
# .. Debian backports have a priority of 100 by default so you will automatically
#    not upgrade to packages from them.
#

# .. envvar:: apt_preferences__debian_stable_default_preset_list [[[
#
# Preset for the stable release of Debian GNU/Linux.
#
# Configuring this in APT is needed because releases (stable, testing,
# unstable) have by default the same priority 500 so when including different
# releases, APT would just select the newest version (usually unstable). To
# avoid this, APT preferences are used to change the preferences to prefer
# stable over testing over unstable.
apt_preferences__debian_stable_default_preset_list:
  - package: '*'
    by_role: 'debops.apt_preferences'
    suffix: '_Debian'
    raw: |
      Explanation: Configure the installed release explicitly to the default priority of 500 so that release packages are preferred.
      Package: *
      Pin: release o=Debian,n={{ ansible_distribution_release }}
      Pin-Priority: 500

      Explanation: Configure the installed release explicitly to the default priority of 500 so that release packages are preferred.
      Package: *
      Pin: release o=Qubes Debian,n={{ ansible_distribution_release }}
      Pin-Priority: 500

      Explanation: The default priority of packages from backports is 100 which is even lower then testing and unstable (500).
      Explanation: Prefer backports over testing and unstable but don’t automatically upgrade to them.
      Package: *
      Pin: release o=Debian Backports,n={{ ansible_distribution_release }}-backports
      Pin-Priority: 400

      Explanation: In case ansible_distribution_release is not (anymore) the current stable release don’t automatically upgrade to it.
      Package: *
      Pin: release o=Debian,a=stable
      Pin-Priority: 100

      Explanation: Install packages from testing if no package with the same name is available in release archives or backports or other archives.
      Package: *
      Pin: release o=Debian,a=testing
      Pin-Priority: 50

      Explanation: Only install packages from unstable if explicitly asked for or the package is pinned.
      Package: *
      Pin: release o=Debian,a=unstable
      Pin-Priority: -1

      Explanation: Only install packages from experimental if explicitly asked for or the package is pinned.
