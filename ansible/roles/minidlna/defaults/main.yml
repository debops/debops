minidlna__original_configuration:

  - name: 'user'
    comment: |
      Specify the user name or uid to run as (root by default).
      On Debian system command line option (from /etc/default/minidlna) overrides this.
    value: 'minidlna'
    state: 'comment'

  - name: 'media_dir'
    comment: |
      Path to the directory you want scanned for media files.

      This option can be specified more than once if you want multiple directories
      scanned.

      If you want to restrict a media_dir to a specific content type, you can
      prepend the directory name with a letter representing the type (A, P or V),
      followed by a comma, as so:
        * "A" for audio    (eg. media_dir=A,/var/lib/minidlna/music)
        * "P" for pictures (eg. media_dir=P,/var/lib/minidlna/pictures)
        * "V" for video    (eg. media_dir=V,/var/lib/minidlna/videos)
        * "PV" for pictures and video (eg. media_dir=PV,/var/lib/minidlna/digital_camera)
    value: [ '/var/lib/minidlna' ]

  - name: 'merge_media_dirs'
    comment: |
      Set this to merge all media_dir base contents into the root container
      (The default is no.)
    value: False
    state: 'comment'

  - name: 'db_dir'
    comment: 'Path to the directory that should hold the database and album art cache.'
    value: '/var/cache/minidlna'
    state: 'comment'

  - name: 'log_dir'
    comment: 'Path to the directory that should hold the log file.'
    value: '/var/log/minidlna'
    state: 'comment'

  - name: 'log_level'
    comment: |
      Type and minimum level of importance of messages to be logged.

      The types are "artwork", "database", "general", "http", "inotify",
      "metadata", "scanner", "ssdp" and "tivo".

      The levels are "off", "fatal", "error", "warn", "info" or "debug".
      "off" turns of logging entirely, "fatal" is the highest level of importance
      and "debug" the lowest.

      The types are comma-separated, followed by an equal sign ("="), followed by a
      level that applies to the preceding types. This can be repeated, separating
      each of these constructs with a comma.

      The default is to log all types of messages at the "warn" level.
    value: 'general,artwork,database,inotify,scanner,metadata,http,ssdp,tivo=warn'
    state: 'comment'

  - name: 'root_container'
    comment: |
      Use a different container as the root of the directory tree presented to
      clients. The possible values are:
        * "." - standard container
        * "B" - "Browse Directory"
        * "M" - "Music"
        * "P" - "Pictures"
        * "V" - "Video"
        * Or, you can specify the ObjectID of your desired root container
          (eg. 1$F for Music/Playlists)
      If you specify "B" and the client device is audio-only then "Music/Folders"
      will be used as root.
    value: '.'
    state: 'comment'
