# The alert manager supports the following options:

#  --config.file="/etc/prometheus/alertmanager.yml"
#       Alertmanager configuration file name.
#  --storage.path="/var/lib/prometheus/alertmanager/"
#       Base path for data storage.
#  --data.retention=120h
#       How long to keep data for.
#  --alerts.gc-interval=30m
#       Interval between alert GC.
#  --log.level=info
#       Only log messages with the given severity or above.
#  --web.external-url=WEB.EXTERNAL-URL
#       The URL under which Alertmanager is externally reachable (for example,
#       if Alertmanager is served via a reverse proxy). Used for generating
#       relative and absolute links back to Alertmanager itself. If the URL has
#       a path portion, it will be used to prefix all HTTP endpoints served by
#       Alertmanager. If omitted, relevant URL components will be derived
#       automatically.
#  --web.route-prefix=WEB.ROUTE-PREFIX
#       Prefix for the internal routes of web endpoints. Defaults to path of
#       --web.external-url.
#  --web.listen-address=":9093"
#       Address to listen on for the web interface and API.
#  --web.ui-path="/usr/share/prometheus/alertmanager/ui/"
#       Path to static UI directory.
#  --template.default="/usr/share/prometheus/alertmanager/default.tmpl"
#       Path to default notification template.
#  --cluster.listen-address="0.0.0.0:9094"
#       Listen address for cluster.
#  --cluster.advertise-address=CLUSTER.ADVERTISE-ADDRESS
#       Explicit address to advertise in cluster.
#  --cluster.peer=CLUSTER.PEER ...
#       Initial peers (may be repeated).
#  --cluster.peer-timeout=15s
#       Time to wait between peers to send notifications.
#  --cluster.gossip-interval=200ms
#       Interval between sending gossip messages. By lowering this value (more
#       frequent) gossip messages are propagated across the cluster more
#       quickly at the expense of increased bandwidth.
#  --cluster.pushpull-interval=1m0s
#       Interval for gossip state syncs. Setting this interval lower (more
#       frequent) will increase convergence speeds across larger clusters at
#       the expense of increased bandwidth usage.
#  --cluster.tcp-timeout=10s  Timeout for establishing a stream connection
#       with a remote node for a full state sync, and for stream read and write
#       operations.
#  --cluster.probe-timeout=500ms
#       Timeout to wait for an ack from a probed node before assuming it is
#       unhealthy. This should be set to 99-percentile of RTT (round-trip time)
#       on your network.
#  --cluster.probe-interval=1s
#       Interval between random node probes. Setting this lower (more frequent)
#       will cause the cluster to detect failed nodes more quickly at the
#       expense of increased bandwidth usage.
#  --cluster.settle-timeout=1m0s
#       Maximum time to wait for cluster connections to settle before
#       evaluating notifications.
#  --cluster.reconnect-interval=10s
#       Interval between attempting to reconnect to lost peers.
#  --cluster.reconnect-timeout=6h0m0s
#       Length of time to attempt to reconnect to a lost peer.
