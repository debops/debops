`debops-contrib.etckeeper` will install [etckeeper][] which puts `/etc`
under version control. To do this it hooks into the package management and
from now on automatically commit changes to a local git repository under
`/etc/.git`.

This makes it easy to see which changes are applied on a specific host and
quickly revert them, if something breaks.

### Credits
This role was influenced by [groover.etckeeper](https://github.com/silpion/ansible-etckeeper)
but has been rewritten from scratch to make it suitable for the DebOps project.
