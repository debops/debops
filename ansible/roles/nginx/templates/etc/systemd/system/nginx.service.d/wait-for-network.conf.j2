# Ensure that 'nginx.service' waits for the network services to be configured
# before starting. This avoids an issue where 'nginx' might fail because remote
# upstream servers defined by hostnames are unreachable.
# Ref: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=943934
#
# This also fixes issues with IPv6 enabled hosts where IPv6 addresses might not
# be configured at the time 'nginx' is started.
# Ref: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=861261
#
# Note that this is the default since Debian package version 1.22.0-2,
# i.e. Debian Bookworm/Ubuntu Mantic or later.
