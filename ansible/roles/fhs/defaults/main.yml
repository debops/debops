  # Directory where user binaries accessible via "$PATH" should be stored.
  - name: 'bin'

  # Directory where additional configuration files not related to existing or
  # packaged services will be stored. Very rarely used.
  - name: 'etc'
    path: '/usr/local/etc'

  # Directory where various scripts which don't or shouldn't be directly
  # accessible from the interactive shell should be stored, so that they don't
  # pollute Tab-completion. Roles can create subdirectories here in case when
  # more than a handful of scripts are used.

  # Directory where administrator binaries accessible via "$PATH" should be
  # stored.

  # Path where static data files should be stored, similar to
  # the '/usr/share' directory. Rarely used.
  - name: 'share'
    path: '/usr/local/share'

  # Path where application sources (tarballs, 'git' repositories) can be stored
  # and operated on, usually in a separate subdirectory for each role or user.
  - name: 'src'
    path: '/usr/local/src'

  # Directory that stores application data, things served by a given host, for
  # example webpages. Web application system accounts may have their home
  # directories there.
  - name: 'data'

  # Alternative directory for application data.
  - name: 'srv'

  # applications, or for the websites installed system-wide. An alternative
  # location of the '/var/www/' directory for non-packaged content.
  - name: 'www'
    path: '/srv/www'

  # Path where local backups generated by automated scripts are stored, usually
  # in separate subdirectories for each user/role.
  - name: 'backup'

  # Path where home directories of local system accounts are stored ('/home' is
  # reserved for regular users and home directories of users stored in remote
  # filesystems like NFS).

  # when the application has its own home directory.
  - name: 'var'
    path: '/var/local'
