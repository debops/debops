# The number of minutes between backup runs under normal conditions. To avoid

# The minimum age of a file, in hours, that will be uploaded. Avoids
# repeated uploads of a file which is constantly being modified.
boxbackup_MinimumFileAge: 4

# If a file is modified repeated, it won't be uploaded immediately in case
# it's modified again, due to the MinimumFileAge specified above. However, it
# should be uploaded eventually even if it is being modified repeatedly. This
# is how long we should wait, in hours, after first noticing a change.

# The daemon does "changes only" uploads for files above this size (in bytes).
# Files less than it are uploaded whole without this extra processing.
boxbackup_DiffingUploadSizeThreshold: 8192

# The limit on how much time is spent diffing files, in seconds. Most files
# shouldn't take very long, but if you have really big files you can use this
# to limit the time spent diffing them.
boxbackup_MaximumDiffingTime: 120

# This specifies a program or script which is run just before each
# sync, and ideally the full path to the interpreter. It will be run as the
# same user bbackupd is running as, usually root.
#
# The script must output (print) either "now" or a number to STDOUT (and a
# terminating newline, no quotes).
#
# If the result was "now", then the sync will happen. If it's a number, then
# no backup will happen for that number of seconds (bbackupd will pause) and
# then the script will be run again.
#
# Use this to temporarily stop bbackupd from syncronising or connecting to the
# store. For example, you could use this on a laptop to only backup when on a
# specific network, or when it has a working Internet connection.
