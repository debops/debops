# ansible-playbook yourappname.yml -i ../inventory
#
# Additional tags to scope things down once your server is setup:
# -t rails_deploy_setup
#    Create the database and transfer the deploy keys, you should only have to
#    do this once but it is tagged just in case you need to change those settings.
#
# -t rails_deploy
#    Run through the motions of setting up the services and deploy tasks.
#    This is the tag you'll be running a majority of the time.
