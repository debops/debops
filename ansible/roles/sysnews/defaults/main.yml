    content: |
      This host has support for the "System News" bulletin, which can be read
      using the 'news' command.

      Members of the '{{ sysnews__group }}' UNIX system group can create news entries in the form
      of text files located in the '/var/lib/sysnews/' directory. The news items
      will automatically expire after a month, unless they are specifically
      marked for no expiration.

      Read the news(1) manpage for more details.

  - name: 'This machine is managed using Ansible'
    content: |
      Ansible is a Configuration Management tool used to configure hosts in an
      automated fashion.

      Any changes in files which are managed using Ansible may be unexpectedly
      lost if not accounted for by the system administrator. These files can be
      recognized by a special annotation near the top of the file which informs
      that this file is managed remotely.

      If you want to perform system modifications on this host, consider
      contacting the system administrators first. They can be reached using
