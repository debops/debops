          Syslog: Tell tinyproxy to use syslog instead of a logfile.  This
          option must not be enabled if the Logfile directive is being used.
          These two directives are mutually exclusive.

          Notice
          Connect   (to log connections without Info's noise)
          Info    (most verbose)

          The LogLevel logs from the set level and above. For example, if the
          LogLevel was set to Warning, then all log messages from Warning to
          Critical would be output, but Notice and below would be suppressed.

      - name: 'upstream'
        comment: |
          Upstream:

          Turns on upstream proxy support.

          The upstream rules allow you to selectively route upstream connections
          based on the host/domain of the site being accessed.

          For example:
           # connection to test domain goes through testproxy
           upstream testproxy:8008 ".test.domain.invalid"
           upstream testproxy:8008 ".our_testbed.example.com"
           upstream testproxy:8008 "192.168.128.0/255.255.254.0"

           # no upstream proxy for internal websites and unqualified hosts
           no upstream ".internal.example.com"
           no upstream "www.example.com"
           no upstream "10.0.0.0/8"
           no upstream "192.168.0.0/255.255.254.0"
           no upstream "."

           # connection to these boxes go through their DMZ firewalls
           upstream cust1_firewall:8008 "testbed_for_cust1"
           upstream cust2_firewall:8008 "testbed_for_cust2"

           # default upstream is internet firewall
           upstream firewall.internal.example.com:80

          The LAST matching rule wins the route decision.  As you can see, you
          can use a host, or a domain:
           name     matches host exactly
           .name    matches any host in domain "name"
           .        matches any host with no domain (in 'empty' domain)
           IP/bits  matches network/mask
           IP/mask  matches network/mask

          If the number of spare servers falls below MinSpareServers then new
          server processes will be spawned.  If the number of servers exceeds
          MaxSpareServers then the extras will be killed off.

          MaxRequestsPerChild: The number of connections a thread will handle
          before it is killed. In practise this should be set to 0, which
          disables thread reaping. If you do notice problems with memory
          leakage, then set this to something like 10000.

          ViaProxyName: The "Via" header is required by the HTTP RFC, but using
          the real host name is a security concern.  If the following directive
          is enabled, the string supplied will be used as the host name in the
          Via header; otherwise, the server's host name will be used.

      - name: 'DisableViaHeader'
        comment: |
          DisableViaHeader: When this is set to yes, Tinyproxy does NOT add
          the Via header to the requests. This virtually puts Tinyproxy into
          stealth mode. Note that RFC 2616 requires proxies to set the Via
          header, so by enabling this option, you break compliance.
          Don't disable the Via header unless you know what you are doing...

          If this directive is commented out, or is set to "No" then the default
          policy is to allow everything which is not specifically denied by the
          filter file.

          However, by setting this directive to "Yes" the default policy becomes
          to deny everything which is _not_ specifically allowed by the filter

          allowed through.  You must include quotes around the headers.

          Most sites require cookies to be enabled for them to work correctly, so

          Configure one or more ReversePath directives to enable reverse proxy
          support. With reverse proxying it's possible to make a number of
          sites appear as if they were part of a single site.

          If you uncomment the following two directives and run tinyproxy
          on your own computer at port 8888, you can access Google using
          http://localhost:8888/google/ and Wired News using
          http://localhost:8888/wired/news/. Neither will actually work
          until you uncomment ReverseMagic as they use absolute linking.
