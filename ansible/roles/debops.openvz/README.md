`debops.openvz` role enables [OpenVZ](http://openvz.org/) container support
on Debian Wheezy hosts. This role has not been tested on Debian Jessie or
Ubuntu systems, and correct support for OpenVZ on these systems is at the
moment unlikely. Main reason for this role is to help ease transition from
older systems based on Debian Squeeze with OpenVZ into newer systems based
on Debian Wheezy/Jessie and LXC.

### Installation

This role requires at least Ansible `v2.0.0`. To install it, run:

    ansible-galaxy install debops.openvz
