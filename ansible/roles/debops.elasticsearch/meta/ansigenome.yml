  synopsis: |
    [Elasticsearch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch) is a distributed
    search engine and storage system, also a part of the Elasticsearch, Logstash,
    Kibana (ELK) stack. The software is developed by [Elastic](https://eastic.co/).

    The `debops.elasticsearch` Ansible role can be used to deploy and manage
    Elasticsearch instances on one or more (3+) hosts. The role can be used as
    a dependency by other Ansible roles to allow control over their configuration
    options in the Elasticsearch configuration file.
