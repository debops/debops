The `debops-contrib.bitcoind` role allows you to manage and configure [bitcoind].
bitcoind can be used to run a [full node]  in the distributed cryptocurrency network [Bitcoin].
A full node is a program that fully validates transactions and blocks and
therefore enforces all of the rules of Bitcoin.
