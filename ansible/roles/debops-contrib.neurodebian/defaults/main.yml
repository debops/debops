#
# APT pinning for packages from the NeuroDebian repository. By default (without
# this pinning), both the official Debian repositories and NeuroDebian have the
# same preference which would lead to APT picking the package with the highest
# version regardless from which repository it comes from.
# As NeuroDebian provides many additional packages along with more recent
# versions of packages already available in official Debian releases, APT
# pinning is used to ensure that package versions available in official Debian
# releases are preferred even if NeuroDebian provides newer versions.
# The job of setting up the APT pinning is offloaded to the
# debops.apt_preferences_ role which is instructed using this variable.
neurodebian__apt_preferences__dependent_list:

  - package: '*'
    reason: |-
      Pin NeuroDebian with priority 80 which is lower then the official Debian backports (100).
      This also works when `apt_preferences__preset_list` is set which increases
      Debian backports to 400 and decreases Debian testing to 50.
