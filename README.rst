``debops.etc_services`` role can be used to "reserve" or "register"
a service port in ``/etc/services`` file. Service ports configured this way
can appear as named entries in many command outputs, such as
``iptables -L`` or ``netstat -lp``.  You can also have convenient database
of reserved and free ports on a particular host, and reference ports by
their names in firewall configuration files.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This role requires at least Ansible ``v1.7.0``. To install it, run:

::

    ansible-galaxy install debops.etc_services
