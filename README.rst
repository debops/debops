``debops.ruby`` role installs selected Ruby version via APT package manager.
By default APT picks the Ruby packages to install automatically - if you
have backported Ruby 2.1 packages, they will be installed if available; if
you don't have them, ``debops.ruby`` will install current Ruby packages
available on your system.

If you want to install Ruby 2.1 packages on Debian Wheezy, set
``ruby_version: 'backport'`` in your inventory and this role will use
``debops.backporter`` role to automatically backport all required packages
from Debian Jessie. These packages will be installed on the build host and
uploaded to Ansible Controller to a specific directory, where
``debops.reprepro`` role can find them and automatically import them to local
APT repository, at which point these packages will become available to all
hosts in a cluster.

This role will also install gems from `RubyGems`_ specified in a list.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This role requires at least Ansible ``v1.7.0``. To install it, run:
