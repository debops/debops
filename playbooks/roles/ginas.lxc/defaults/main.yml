# ---- Build LXC 1.0 on Debian Wheezy ----

# Wheezy at the moment has only LXC 0.8 in its repositories, and version 1.0
# will probably not be backported soon, if at all. Because of that, ginas
# playbook can automatically:
#  - build LXC 1.0.x packages from Debian source packages in Jessie (enabled
#    automatically in Wheezy if sufficient packages are not available);
#  - redistribute built packages within the ginas cluster using local .deb
#    repository via reprepro;
# More information about the process can be found in
# 'tasks/build_lxc_from_testing.yml'

# Package building is enabled automatically if certain conditions apply, here
# you can enforce building the packages

# version (by default ginas will build and install current LXC package from

# to last element of this path)
lxc_build_path: '/usr/local/src/lxc'

# Upload the built LXC 1.0 packages to local Debian repository? Enable this
# only once and disable afterwards (unless you are upgrading the packages). This
# will upload .deb packages to Ansible Controller and put them in directory where
# 'reprepro' role expects local Debian packages. After re-running Ansible with
# 'apt' role on local repository host, new packages will be available on hosts
# that use local repository.

# ---- Manage LXC containers ----

# LXC containers managed by Ansible are defined in a list below. Each entry is
# a hash with keys as container parameters. Container configuration parameters
# are interpreted only on initial container creation and are not updated
# automatically afterwards.

# List of required parameters:
#   - name: ''               container name, will be used as subdomain
#                            in dnsmasq NAT configuration.

# List of optional parameters:
#   - state: ''              defines what state should that container be in on
#                            next Ansible run. Recognized states:
#                              - started    (container should be running)
#                              - stopped    (container should be stopped)
#                              - absent     (container will be destroyed)
#                            Without this parameter container will be created,
#                            but not started automatically.
#   - config: True or ''     enables usage of custom configuration instead of
#                            default from /etc/lxc/default.conf
#                            If True, container will be created with configuration

#                            Otherwise specify absolute path to a configuration
#                            file to use (for example '/etc/lxc/nat.conf').
#   - template: ''           template from /usr/share/lxc/templates/ to use for
#                            this container, instead of the default.
#   - template_options: ''   string of freeform options added at the end of
#                            lxc-create command, after "--".

#                            See 'man lxc-create' for available options.
#   - network: ''            if 'config' option is not set, 'network' value becomes
#                            a "shortcut" to select specific config file from /etc/lxc/*
#                            (for example, you can specify 'network: "nat"' and host
#                            will be configured with config file from /etc/lxc/nat.conf).

# List of parameters recognized with 'config: True' (generated configuration):
#   - network: ''            currently you can specify 'external' or 'nat'
#                            to connect default network interface of a container
#                            to specified network interface of a host.
#   - hwaddr: ''             if 'network' option is set, you can specify Ethernet
#                            address of container network interface.
#   - auto: True/False       by default containers are configured to start
#                            automatically at boot; using this option you can
#                            disable autostart of a container.
#   - options: |             text block, will be added at the end of the configuration
#                            file.
