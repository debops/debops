# ---- ISC DHCP Server configuration scopes ----

# These lists allow you to generate nested configuration scopes in
# dhcpd.conf. Most of the information about them can be found in dhcpd.conf(5)
# manual page. You can create nested configuration using Ansible variable
# expansion (examples below).

# List of general configuration parameters (work in any configuration scope):
#  - comment: ''            add a comment to a scope
#  - options: |             custom options for that scope defined as a text block
#  - include: ''            path to external file to include in this scope

# List of hosts (works in groups, subnets):
#  - hosts: '' or []        list of hosts to configure in that scope; if this is
#                           a path to a file, dhcpd will include an external file

#                           each match expression must end with a colon to indicate
#                           hash key; optional
