backporter_mail_subject: 'Backport of {{ backporter_package }} package uploaded to Ansible Controller'

backporter_mail_body: |
  Ansible has built new "{{ backporter_package }}" package on {{ ansible_fqdn }},
  which is a backported version from {{ backporter_distribution }} {{ backporter_next[backporter_release] | capitalize }}.
  This package was built because requested version {{ backporter_version }} was not found
  in configured APT repositories.
  
  Generated packages have been uploaded to Ansible Controller and can be
  redistributed to local APT repositories managed by 'reprepro'. To do that,
  re-run Ansible playbook on hosts configured to manage local APT repositories,
  which should download new .deb packages and update their repositories
  automatically.
  
  Packages can be found on Ansible Controller in:
      {{ backporter_upload_storage | realpath }}
  
  List of generated .deb packages:
  
  {% for package in backporter_register_packages_to_upload.stdout_lines %}
  {{ package | replace('./','') | indent(4,true) }}
  {% endfor %}
