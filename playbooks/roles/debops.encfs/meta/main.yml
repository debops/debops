  synopsis: |
    Ansible role `encfs` allows you to create and manage directories using
    [EncFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EncFS), FUSE-based encrypted virtual
    filesystem.
    
    Primary mode of operation is to provide encrypted and secure storage space
    for passwords and sensitive files on localhost (Ansible Controller) using
    GPG-encrypted keyfile as password for EncFS. Access to 'root' account (via
    sudo) is only required during a setup phase to install 'fuse' and 'encfs'
    packages, and fix `/dev/fuse` access permissions; otherwise role works with
    a regular user account.
    
    Role supports directories in remote hosts encrypted using a password with
    optional "passfile" as a transport for passwords in transit.

  usage: |
    To use 'encfs' role for encrypted storage for all your hosts, you should
    set at least one variable (for example `secret`) in
    `inventory/group_vars/all.yml` which will point to a directory in your
    local filesystem. By default, 'encfs' will create an keyfile and encrypt it
    using a GPG passphrase. To change how 'encfs' behaves, in
    `inventory/host_vars/localhost.yml` set variables like `encfs_gpg`,
    `encfs_password`, `encfs_passfile` (described above). This way the scope of
    the `encfs_*` variables will be limited only to `localhost`.
    
    You have to add 'localhost' to your inventory, preferably at the begginning
    of the `hosts` file, like this:
    
        localhost ansible_connection=local
    
    Add two plays at the beginning and end of your playbook, like this:
    
        ---
        - hosts: localhost
          sudo: no
          roles:
            - role: debops.encfs
              encfs: '{{ secret }}'
              encfs_mode: 'open'
        
        - hosts: all:!localhost
          # your plays here
        
        - hosts: localhost
          sudo: no
          roles:
            - role: debops.encfs
              encfs: '{{ secret }}'
              encfs_mode: 'close'
    
    When you will run a playbook modified as above for the first time, Ansible
    might require `sudo` access to install 'fuse' and 'encfs' packages, fix
    `/dev/fuse` access permissions and add your user to 'fuse' group. If that
    happens, 'encfs' role will stop playbook and inform you that you need to
    log out and back in to have 'fuse' group available.
    
    Another way to use 'encfs' role for encrypted global storage is to create
    a shell script, and run that role using separate `ansible-playbook`
    commands. Here's an example script:
    
        #!/bin/bash
        
        if [ $SECRET -gt 0 ] ; then
        	ansible-playbook -i inventory playbooks/secret.yml --extra-vars='encfs_mode=open'
        	trap "ansible-playbook -i inventory playbooks/secret.yml --extra-vars='encfs_mode=close'" EXIT
        fi
        
        ansible-playbook -i inventory playbooks/site.yml $@
    
    And in `playbooks/secret.yml` you should create a playbook:
    
        - hosts: localhost
          sudo: no
          roles:
            - role: debops.encfs
              encfs: '{{ secret }}'
    
    When you run that script, you can specify `ansible-playbook` options as
    normal, and they will be used with correct command. When last of your plays
    finishes, shell script will run Ansible with `encfs` role again, to close
    encrypted filesystem.
