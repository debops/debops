# role: encfs (encrypted virtual filesystem)


# Absolute path to a directory where encrypted filesystem will be mounted
# Required
encfs: False

# Suffix of the directory with encrypted filesystem, it will be created in the
# same path as the mount directory
encfs_suffix: ".encrypted"

# List of GPG keys to use to encrypt encfs keyfile. GPG encryption is supported
# only on localhost (hosts which have ansible_connection=local set). Without
# list of GPG recipients, GnuPG will ask for a passphrase instead
encfs_gpg: []

# Password to use instead of GPG keys / GPG passphrase. Supports encfs on
# remote hosts. Will be sent via stdout and visible in 'ps' and Ansible logs,
# use an external file with encfs_passfile to mitigate that.
# You can populate this variable from an external file using lookup('file','path')
encfs_password: False

# An absolute path to file on remote host to store the password in transit.
# Will be shredded when no longer needed. encfs role creates two files with this
# name + suffixes '_init' and '_pass'

# By default encfs role behaves as a toggle - opens the encrypted filesystem if
# it's closed, closes it if opened. By setting encfs_mode (for example with
# --extra-vars) you can force desired mode of operation:
#  - 'open' - create or open encrypted filesystem
#  - 'close' - close encrypted filesystem
encfs_mode: False

# Device to use as source of randomness. You can change that to '/dev/urandom'
# to use faster but weaker randomness source
encfs_random: '/dev/random'
