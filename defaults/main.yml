# Local services [[[
# ------------------

# The following lists allow you to generate entries for local services not
# included in the officially distributed :file:`/etc/services` file. They will
# generate separate files for each configured service in :file:`/etc/services.d/`
# which then will be assembled into the :file:`/etc/services` file.
#
# ``name``
#   String, required. Name of the service.
#
# ``port``
#   String, required. Port of the service.
#
# ``protocols``
#   List of strings, optional. Transport layer protocols of the service
#   corresponding with ``port``.
#   Common choices: ``tcp``, ``udp``.
#
# ``protocol``
#   Deprecated! Use ``protocol``.
#
# ``comment``
#   String, optional. Comment to add to the service entry.
#
# ``filename``
#   String, optional. Use this filename instead of a generated one.
#
# ``custom``
#   String, optional. Specify custom file contents instead of templated one. If
#   it is used, options like ``name`` and ``port`` are ignored.
#
# ``state``
#   Either ``present`` or ``absent``. If it's defined and ``absent``, the local
#   service configuration will be removed.
#
# ``delete``
#   Boolean, optional, defaults to False. Delete the given local service.
#
# Example::
#
#    etc_services__list:

#      - name: 'servicename'
