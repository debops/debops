# List of NTP servers to synchronize with
# If you use NTPd, you can add server options in server strings, for example:
#   '0.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst minpoll 6 maxpoll 10'
# If you're syncing against local servers, recommended options are --
# 'burst iburst minpoll 4 maxpoll 4', where:
#  - 'burst' and 'iburst' -- Get stratum as fast as possible by sending 8 sync
#                            querys with 2 second interval. (Beware though,
#                            this is considered as an abuse on public servers!)
#  - minpoll, maxpoll -- Min/max interval for sync querys to be sent in normal
#                        operation mode. It's defined in seconds as a
#                        power of two:
#                         4 -- 16 seconds (minimal allowed)
#                         5 -- 32 seconds
#                         6 -- 64 seconds
