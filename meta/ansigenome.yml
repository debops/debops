  synopsis: |
    The `debops.core` Ansible role takes care of variables that are shared among
    different roles and are useful to keep in a central location. This is done by
    leveraging functionality of [Ansible local facts][]
    stored on remote hosts to ensure that the variables are always evaluated by
    Ansible, even when playbook is run with or without different sets of role tags.
