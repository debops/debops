  synopsis: |
    The `debops.redis` role allows you to easily setup infrastructure capable of
    running and managing 1 or more Redis servers. It is completely self healing
    with Redis Sentinel and supports replication seamlessly.

    Few features available in this role:

    - seamless master/slave replication;
    - throw together a master + n slaves + n sentinel setup in about 10 lines of YAML
      (most of those lines would be adding your hosts to the inventory);
    - your configs are idempotent, even when redis rewrites them;
    - pretty much every redis config value is tweakable;
    - you can easily use this role as a dependency in your other roles;
