  synopsis: |
    `debops.cryptsetup` allows you to configure encrypted filesystems on top of
    any given block device using [dm-crypt][]/[cryptsetup][] and [LUKS][].  A random
    keyfile generated on the Ansible controller will be used for the encryption by
    default.  It is your responsibility that the keyfile is kept secure for this to
    make sense.  For example by storing the keyfile on an already encrypted
    filesystem (both on the Ansible controller and the remote system).

    ### Features

    * Create a random keyfile or use an already existing keyfile.
    * Manage :file:`/etc/crypttab` and :file:`/etc/fstab` and mount point directories.
    * Create a LUKS header backup and store it on the Ansible controller.
    * Decrypt and mount a encrypted filesystem and delete the decryption key from
      persistent storage after mounting.
