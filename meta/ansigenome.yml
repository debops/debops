  synopsis: |
    [Preseeding](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed) is a way to
    configure the Debian Installer non-interactively. During installation,
    a special text file can be downloaded over HTTP, this file can provide
    answers to the installer questions.

    After installation, a custom shell script will be downloaded and run in the
    target environment to prepare host for remote use (an admin account will be
    created, SSH keys will be configured, optionally a Salt Minion will be
    installed and will start on the next boot).
