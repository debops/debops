    [RStudio](http://rstudio.com/) is an Integrated Development Environment for
    R programming language.
    
    This Ansible role will let you deploy RStudio Server, which is RStudio
    implemented as a web application accessible in a browser. Basic
    R environment will be installed as well (you can also disable RStudio if
    you want and set up only R).
    
    Before using this role, you need to provide `rstudio-server` and
    `libssl0.9.8` packages for your host using an APT repository. See the
