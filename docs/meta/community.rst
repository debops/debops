Community
=========

DebOps has a small but active community of developers and users. Come on in and
say hi!

DebOps monorepo
---------------

Main development of the project is done in its :command:`git` monorepo, using
a distributed development model. The default location of the monorepo is the
`DebOps GitHub repository`__, used for the issues and pull requests. There's
also a `read-only mirror on GitLab`__ used to manage the public test pipeline
based on `GitLab CI`__.

The developers and users maintain their own `monorepo forks`__ on GitHub, used
for development and pull requests.

Matrix room
-----------

DebOps has its own room in the `Matrix`__ network, `#debops:matrix.org`__. You
can access it over the Web or via a mobile app using the `Element`__ Matrix
client. Matrix provides us with notifications from GitHub about new issues and
pull requests in the DebOps monorepo.

The room is bridged to the FreeNode IRC channel, so both communities can talk
to each other.

IRC channels
------------

The ``#debops`` IRC channel on the `Libera.Chat`__ IRC network can be used to
talk about DebOps, Debian, Ansible and general sysadmin related stuff. Feel
free to come over and say hello. The channel is not yet bridged to the DebOps
room on the Matrix network, we will do that as soon as possible.

The ``#debops`` IRC channel on the `FreeNode`__ IRC network has been active for
almost as long as the DebOps project itself. You can use it to chat in real
time about DebOps, get help with any pressing issues and compare notes with
other DebOps users. It is connected to the DebOps room on the Matrix network as
well, so both communities can talk with each other.

Mailing list
------------

The DebOps project has `its own mailing list`__, ``debops-users``, based on
Mailman. The list has low traffic and is used for notifications about
significant changes in the project, and more asynchronous communication. You
can also check out the `mailing list archives`__.

The /r/debops subreddit
-----------------------

The DebOps project has its own `/r/debops`__ subreddit on the `Reddit`__
website. Come over to talk about the project and post interesting links related
to DebOps.
