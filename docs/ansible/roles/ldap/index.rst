debops.ldap
===========

`Lightweight Directory Access Protocol`__ is a popular and standardized
protocol that permits applications to access structured data. It can be used to
build and manage clustered environments with central authentication and access
control based on directory services that allow efficient searching and
retrieval of data.

The ``debops.ldap`` Ansible role can set up system-wide LDAP configuration on
a Debian/Ubuntu host, and provide LDAP-based applications, as well as other
Ansible roles, information necessary to connect them to a LDAP directory
service. In addition to that, ``debops.ldap`` role can be used via Ansible
inventory, or as a dependent role by other Ansible roles, to perform tasks in
the LDAP directory itself, on behalf of the Ansible user.
