LDAP - POSIX environment integration
====================================

The LDAP directory uses a hierarchical structure to store its objects and their
attributes, this structure can be thought of as a N-dimesional object. In
contrast to this, POSIX or UNIX environments use a flat UID and GID namespace
of entities (users, groups, services, etc.) which can be thought of as
a two-dimesional surface.  There are different ways of representing
a N-dimesional objects on two-dimesional surfaces, unfortunately this cannot be
done without compromise.

LDAP-POSIX support in DebOps
----------------------------

The :envvar:`ldap__posix_enabled` default variable controls if the LDAP-POSIX
integration should be done on a given host. By default the integration will be
enabled, based on the value of the :envvar:`ldap__enabled` variable. This
choice will also be recorded in the Ansible local facts as
``ansible_local.ldap.posix_enabled`` variable, which will preserve the current
state of the integration on subsequent Ansible runs.

If the POSIX support is disabled by setting the :envvar:`ldap__posix_enabled`
variable to ``False``, DebOps roles which manage services in the POSIX
environment will not configure LDAP support automatically - the required LDAP
accounts will not be created and the service configuration will not rely on
LDAP directory. Other, higher level services will be integrated with the
directory as usual.

POSIX attributes
----------------

This is a list of the LDAP object attributes that are significant in a POSIX
environment, managed via the ``passwd`` database:

- ``uid``
- ``uidNumber``
- ``gidNumber``
- ``gecos``
- ``homeDirectory``
- ``loginShell``

And a similar list, for the ``group`` database:

- ``gid`` [#f1]_
- ``gidNumber``

These attributes are defined by the ``posixAccount``, ``posixGroup`` and
``posixGroupId`` LDAP object types. All of them are auxiliary [#f2]_, and can
be added to any LDAP objects in the directory.

Group membership should be defined by creating a ``groupOfNames`` LDAP object
with ``posixGroup`` and ``posixGroupId`` types and using the ``member``
attribute to specify the Distinguished Names of the group members.

`User Private Groups`__ can be defined by adding the ``posixAccount``,
``posixGroup`` and ``posixGroupId`` to a LDAP object, for example
``inetOrgPerson``. In this case the ``uid`` and ``gid`` attributes should
define the same name. Check the :ref:`slapd__ref_posixgroupid` documentation
for more details.

Reserved UID/GID ranges
-----------------------

LDAP directory is commonly used in large, distributed environments as a global
account and group database. Because of the long operational lifetime of these
environments, counting in dozens of years or more, and issues with modification
of UID and GID values in large environments, good selection of the UID/GID
ranges reserved for use in the LDAP directory is a priority.

The `systemd`__ project has an excellent rundown of the UIDs and GIDs used on
typical Linux systems `in their documentation`__. You can also read the Debian
FAQ answer that `describes the default UNIX accounts and groups`__ present on a
Debian system. As an example of production UID/GID range allocation, you can
check the `UID/GID allocation page`__ in the documentation published by the
University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory.

The factors taken into account during the default UID/GID range selection for
the :ref:`debops.ldap` role are:

- Large number of UNIX accounts, both for normal users and applications,
  starting with 50 000+ entries, with UID/GID of a given account reserved for
  a lifetime. Yearly increase in the number of accounts being 1000-5000, for
  example in a typical university.

- Support for unprivileged LXC containers, which use their own separate
  subUID/subGID ranges in the same namespace as the LXC host. This implies that
  the selected UID/GID range needs to be half of maximum size supported by the
  operatimg system, or less, to allow for unprivileged UID/GID mapping on the
  LXC host.

- Support for `User Private Groups`__ defined in the LDAP directory, which
  allows easier collaboration between users. This means that each UNIX account
  requires its own private UNIX group, ideally with the same name as the
  account, and the same UID/GID number.

  .. __: https://wiki.debian.org/UserPrivateGroups

- Avoid collisions with existing UID/GID ranges used on Linux systems for local
  UNIX accounts and groups, or those reserved by common applications like
  ``systemd``. This implies that the UID/GID numbers <1100 should be off-limits
  for LDAP directory to not collide with common desktop PC installations.
  Ideally the 0-65535 UID/GID range should be avoided altogether to allow for
  a continuous UID/GID range which makes randomized allocation easier.

With these parameters in mind, the 1879048192…2147483647 UID/GID range,
highlighted in the table above, seems to be the best candidate to contain
a reserved LDAP UID/GID range.

Suggested LDAP UID/GID ranges
-----------------------------

The :ref:`debops.ldap` role defines a set of Ansible local facts that specify
the UID/GID range reserved for use in the LDAP directory. The range is somewhat
arbitrary and users are free to change it or not conform to the selected
UID/GID range in their environments, however the selected range affects other
applications configured by DebOps roles, for example:

- the range of subUIDs/subGIDs used for unprivileged containers
- the minimum and maximum UID/GID from the LDAP directory included in the
  ``passwd`` and ``group`` databases
- the range of UIDs/GIDs allocated randomly by account management applications
  that support this functionality

and so on. The Ansible roles that want to conform to the selected UID/GID
ranges can access them via Ansible local facts:

- :envvar:`ldap__uid_gid_min` -> ``ansible_local.ldap.uid_gid_min``
- :envvar:`ldap__uid_gid_max` -> ``ansible_local.ldap.uid_gid_max``

To allow for consistent UID/GID allocation in `User Private Groups`__,
a separate UID/GID range at the start of the allocated namespace has been
reserved to contain only groups. The UIDs/GIDs above this range should be used
only for personal or service accounts with correspodning private groups of the
same name and GID as the account. The group range is defined in Ansible local
facts as well:

- :envvar:`ldap__groupid_min` -> ``ansible_local.ldap.groupid_min``
- :envvar:`ldap__groupid_max` -> ``ansible_local.ldap.groupid_max``

.. __: https://wiki.debian.org/UserPrivateGroups

The selected LDAP UID/GID range (``2000000000-2099999999``) allows for 100 000
000 unique POSIX accounts. The range reserved for groups
(``2000000000-2001999999``) supports 2 000 000 unique groups. Users can
increase or decrease the group range inside of the maximum UID/GID range, but
going beyond that comes with a risk of exceeding the maximum UID/GID supported
by the operating system and Unforeseen Consequences. The UID/GID ranges can be
divided further between different purposes, but that's beyond the scope of this
role.

With the selected ranges, a set of subUIDs/subGIDs (``210000000-420000000``) is
also possible, therefore this range should be safe to use inside of the LXC
containers. Note however, that the UID/GID range above ``2147483648`` is
considered risky due to issues in some of the kernel subsystems and userspace
tools that don't work well with UIDs outside of the signed 32bit range. This
puts an upper limit on the normal set of UID/GID numbers to ``2047483647`` if
you want to stay away from that region.

This unfortunately limits the ability to completely separate containers using
private subUID/subGID ranges for each of them, but since the UID/GID numbers
inside of the containers will belong to the same "entity" be it a person or
a service, the risk in the case of breach between LXC containers should be
minimized.


.. _ldap__ref_next_uid_gid:

Next available UID/GID tracking
-------------------------------

An important part of the POSIX environment is ensuring that UID and GID values
are unique across the entire infrastructure. This is problematic with an LDAP
directory due to a lack of the "auto-increment" feature which would allow for
easy creation of new accounts with unique ``uidNumber`` and ``gidNumber``
values. Another risk is the possibility of a collision when two or more
entities in a distributed environment are trying to create a new account at the
same time.

A solution to this is to track the next available ``uidNumber`` and
``gidNumber`` values inside of the directory itself, using :ref:`special objects
defined by a separate schema <slapd__ref_nextuidgid_schema>` and use an atomic
LDAP delete+add operation to ensure that the next available UID or GID is
reserved for our purposes. This solution was inspired by the `UIDNumber
Attribute Auto-Incrementing Method`__ article.

.. __: https://www.rexconsulting.net/ldap-protocol-uidnumber.html/

Design overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When initializing a LDAP directory, DebOps creates two LDAP objects to track
the next available UID and GID separately:

- ``cn=Next POSIX UID,ou=System,dc=example,dc=org``
- ``cn=Next POSIX GID,ou=System,dc=example,dc=org``

The ``Next POSIX UID`` object is meant to track user accounts with their
corresponding User Private Groups; it will be initialized by the
:ref:`debops.slapd` Ansible role with the next available UID after the admin
account is created. The ``Next POSIX UID`` object is similarly initialized by
the same role after all required groups are created. Users can create
additional sets of UID/GID tracking objects for various purposes using the
``uidNext`` or ``gidNext`` LDAP object classes.

The ``uidNumber`` and ``gidNumber`` values can be modified by the members of
the ``cn=UNIX Administrators`` group. The ``unique`` overlay ensures that these
values are not repeated anywhere in the LDAP directory, and when they are
incremented the specified values will be available for use.

How to acquire a new UID/GID
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mechanism of acquiring a new UID or GID needs to be implemented in the
client applications that manage user accounts. Here you can find an explanation
of how to get a new UID; getting a new GID is the same, just involves
a different LDAP object.

1. Search for the next available ``uidNumber`` value by checking the contents
   of the ``cn=Next POSIX UID,ou=System,dc=example,dc=org`` LDAP entry. An
   example CLI command:

   .. code-block:: console

      ldapsearch -Z -LLL '(& (objectClass=uidNext) (cn=Next POSIX UID) )' uidNumber

   Store the ``uidNumber`` value you found in the application memory for now.

2. Create a "delete + add" LDAP operation (not "replace", which is not atomic).
   The operation should tell the LDAP directory to remove the specific
   ``uidNumber`` value we found using the search query and add a new one,
   incremented by 1. An example LDIF with the operation:

   .. code-block:: none

      dn: cn=Next POSIX UID,ou=System,dc=example,dc=org
      changetype: modify
      delete: uidNumber
      uidNumber: 2002000001
      -
      add: uidNumber
      uidNumber: 2002000002

3. Execute the operation on the LDAP directory. If it fails, the existing value
   won't be changed, so the operation is safe to use. An example CLI command
   with the above file:

   .. code-block:: console

      ldapmodify -Z -f nextuid.ldif

4. Check the operation status returned by the server. If the operation
   succeeded, you can use the UID value you got at the first step and be sure
   that it is unique and available. If the operation failed, it means that
   somebody else has got the UID you currently keep in memory and it is
   reserved. In that case go back to step 1, search for the current available
   UID and try again.


Collisions with local UNIX accounts/groups
------------------------------------------

The POSIX environments permit duplicate entries in the ``passwd`` and ``group``
databases, that is entries with the same user or group names, or duplicate
UID/GID numbers. However, most of the time, only the first entry found in the
database is returned. This might cause confusion and hard to debug issues in
the environment, or even security breaches if not handled properly.

The various DebOps roles that automatically manage custom UNIX groups or
accounts, for example :ref:`debops.system_groups`, will check if the LDAP
support is enabled on a given host. If it's enabled, they will automatically
prepend ``_`` character to any custom UNIX accounts or UNIX groups created by
them, which will affect the user or group names, home directory names,
:command:`sudo` rules, group membership, etc. The names of UNIX groups or
accounts present by default on Debian or Ubuntu systems (``adm``, ``staff``, or
other such cases) that are managed by these Ansible roles will not be changed.
For example, the local equivalent of the LDAP ``admins`` group will be changed
to ``_admins``. Local UNIX accounts of the administrators (``user``) will be
renamed to ``_user``, and so on.

These changes will not be performed on already configured hosts if the LDAP
support is enabled later on, to not create duplicate entries in the local user
and group databases. In these cases, administrators are advised to either apply
the desired modifications by themselves, or rebuild the hosts with LDAP support
enabled from scratch.

Other DebOps or Ansible roles can also implement similar modifications to UNIX
user or group names of the applications they manage, but that's not strictly
required. LDAP administrators and editors should take care that the user
(``uid``) and group (``gid``) names don't clash with the UNIX user and group
names of different applications installed locally, to not cause collisions.
