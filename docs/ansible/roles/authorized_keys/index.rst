debops.authorized_keys
======================

The ``debops.authorized_keys`` role can be used to manage SSH keys centrally in
the :file:`/etc/ssh/authorized_keys/` directory. The role only manages the keys
themselves, you should configure the ``sshd`` service to use them separately,
for example by using the :ref:`debops.sshd` Ansible role.
