LXD installation details
------------------------

At the time of writing this role (December 2019) LXD was not available natively
in Debian. `Packaging efforts are ongoing`__, however there's no telling if LXD
will be included in the next Debian release (Bullseye). The upstream developers
`suggest installation on Debian via Snap`__, however this brings its own set of
issues which are offtopic here.

.. __: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=768073
.. __: https://stgraber.org/2017/01/18/lxd-on-debian/

Instead, on Debian hosts the :ref:`debops.lxd` role utilizes the
:ref:`debops.golang` role to install the :command:`lxd` and :command:`lxc`
binaries from upstream :command:`git` repository by compiling them from source.
The role will configure the rest of the needed infrastructure
(:command:`systemd` unit files, :command:`logrotate` and :command:`sysctl`
configuration, POSIX groups, log directory, etc.) so that the LXD service
should work out of the box on Debian without the need of a Snap installation.

The :ref:`debops.golang` configuration for building and installing LXD is
defined in the :envvar:`lxd__golang__dependent_packages` variable.

Due to the build dependency on the ``lxc-dev`` APT package, which pulls the
``lxc`` APT package automatically, the :ref:`debops.lxc` role and its
dependencies will be used to configure the LXC environment. The ``lxcbr0``
network bridge will be automatically disabled in this case.

.. warning:: Merge commits in the `lxc/lxd`__ GitHub repository might be signed
   with the `GPG key issued by GitHub`__, used for `signing commits done in the web
   interface`__. It has to be done, because tagged LXD releases `have problems
   with their dependency chains`__ and due to that the :ref:`debops.lxd` role
   relies on stable branches in the LXD repository. The trust is limited to the
   ``_golang`` UNIX account and might have an impact for any Go applications
   built in that specific environment.

Example inventory
-----------------

To enable LXD support on a host, it needs to be added to the
``[debops_service_lxd]`` Ansible inventory group:

.. code-block:: none

   [debops_all_hosts:children]
   lxd_hosts
   lxd_containers

   [debops_service_lxd:children]
   lxd_hosts

   [lxd_hosts]
   lxd-host    ansible_host=lxd-host.example.org

   [lxd_containers]
   webserver   ansible_host=webserver.example.org

By default, containers will use the ``lxdbr0`` bridge managed by the LXD
service, with their own internal ``lxd`` subdomain. You can use the
:ref:`debops.ifupdown` Ansible role to configure additional network bridges on
the LXD host, if you want to attach the containers to the public network.


Example playbook
----------------

If you are using this role without DebOps, here's an example Ansible playbook
that uses the ``debops.lxd`` role:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../ansible/playbooks/service/lxd.yml
   :language: yaml
   :lines: 1,5-


Ansible tags
------------

You can use Ansible ``--tags`` or ``--skip-tags`` parameters to limit what
tasks are performed during Ansible run. This can be used after a host was first
configured to speed up playbook execution, when you are sure that most of the
configuration is already in the desired state.

Available role tags:

``role::lxd``
  Main role tag, should be used in the playbook to execute all of the role
  tasks as well as role dependencies.

``role::lxd:init``
  Re-apply the LXD preseeding configuration. Requires the
  :envvar:`lxd__init_preseed` variable to be set to ``True`` to be effective.
