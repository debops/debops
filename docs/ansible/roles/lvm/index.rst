==========

`Logical Volume Manager`_ lets you manage your disk space in a more elastic
way, separating physical hard disks from the logical volumes.

This Ansible role lets you configure :file:`/etc/lvm/lvm.conf` configuration file,
as well as gives you a set of variables which can be used to manage LVM logical
volumes, automatically create filesystems on them and mount them as needed.
