- name: Support yourappname
  hosts: debops_rails_yourappname
  become: true

  roles:
    - { role: rails_deploy, tags: yourappname }

# Basic usage which runs everything:
# ansible-playbook yourappname.yml -i ../inventory
#
# Additional tags to scope things down once your server is setup:
# -t rails_deploy_setup
#    Create the database and transfer the deploy keys, you should only have to
#    do this once but it is tagged just in case you need to change those settings.
#
# -t rails_deploy
#    Run through the motions of setting up the services and deploy tasks.
#    This is the tag you'll be running a majority of the time.
#
# -t nginx
#    Install and configure nginx if it is in the dependency list.
#
# -t postgresql
#    Install and configure postgresql if it is in the list and you selected postgresql.
#
# -t mysql
#    Install and configure mysql if it is in the list and you selected mysql.
