DebOps provides support for Icinga 2, split into several roles:

- the :ref:`debops.icinga` role is the Icinga 2 Agent role, usually installed
  on all hosts in the cluster that should be monitored. Different instances can
  function as masters, satellites or clients depending on the configuration.

- the :ref:`debops.icinga_db` role can be used to configure the database
  support for Icinga 2, used by the web interface. Both PostgreSQL and MariaDB
  databases are supported.

- the :ref:`debops.icinga_web` role manages the Icinga 2 Web interface,
  including installation of external modules like Icinga 2 Director.
