Upstream package is used by default
-----------------------------------

The :ref:`debops.kibana` role depends on the :ref:`debops.extrepo`
Ansible role to configure access to the Elastic.co APT repository. This means
that usually the latest available Kibana release will be installed by
default. If you require older releases, you can use the
:ref:`debops.apt_preferences` role to select the desired package version.

Alternatively, you can "mask" the
:envvar:`kibana__extrepo__dependent_sources` variable in the Ansible
inventory and configure the APT repositories yourself via the :ref:`debops.apt`
role.


Kibana is insecure by default
-----------------------------

The Kibana dashboard relies on Elasticsearch to ensure secure communication
between cluster nodes. The default configuration expects an Elasticsearch
instance installed on the same host, preferably in a "load balancer" mode, that
is with no master possibility, no data or ingest functions enabled on the node.

Kibana by default does not include any authentication or ACL support; however
the role by default does not configure any access restrictions. If you want to
have a simple security solution, you can use ``kibana__webserver_*`` variables
to configure HTTP Basic Auth in the :command:`nginx` frontend. Keep in mind
that once a user is authenticated using this method, he/she has full access to
the Elasticsearch cluster.

If the first host used for connections to the Elasticsearch cluster uses
a ``https://`` connection, Kibana will try to use the ``kibana_system``
Elasticsearch user account and password stored in the
:file:`secret/elasticsearch/credentials/` directory (managed by the
:ref:`debops.secret` role) to authorize itself with the cluster and set up its
own configuration. After that, you can use other users (notably ``elastic``
superuser account) to access the web interface.

You can install additional plugins that provide encrypted connections,
authentication, authorization and access control:

- `X-Pack <https://www.elastic.co/products/x-pack>`_, an Elastic
  commercial plugin with free trial period. Supports encryption,
  authentication, access control, integrates with Elasticsearch and Logstash.
  Since the plugin is developed by the same team, its releases are in parallel
  with Kibana.

- `Search Guard <http://floragunn.com/searchguard/>`_, an open source third
  party plugin with commercial support. Has features comparable with X-Pack,
  with more basic features like HTTP and transport encryption, basic
  authentication and access control available free of charge.


Use as a role dependency
------------------------

The Kibana main configuration file
`does not support an include statement or conf.d directory <https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11362>`_.
To mitigate that and allow multiple Kibana configuration sources from other
Ansible roles, the ``debops.kibana`` role supports operation as a dependent
role. This functionality can be used by other Ansible roles to better manage
Kibana plugins or extend the configuration without the need to implement the
entire role again and with preserved idempotency.

See the :ref:`kibana__ref_dependency` for more details.


Example inventory
-----------------

To deploy Kibana, you can add the host to the
``[debops_service_kibana]`` Ansible inventory group. By default Kibana expects
an Elasticsearch instance on the same host to leverage the cluster load
balancing. To install an ES node in a load balancer configuration, include the
host in the ``[debops_service_elasticsearch_lb]`` inventory group:

.. code-block:: none

   [debops_service_kibana]
   hostname

   [debops_service_elasticsearch_lb]
   hostname

See the documentation of the ``debops.elasticsearch`` role about different
Ansible inventory group types and their usage.


Example playbook
----------------

If you are using this role without DebOps, here's an example Ansible playbook
that uses the ``debops.kibana`` role:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../ansible/playbooks/service/kibana.yml
   :language: yaml
   :lines: 1,5-


Ansible tags
------------

You can use Ansible ``--tags`` or ``--skip-tags`` parameters to limit what
tasks are performed during Ansible run. This can be used after a host was first
configured to speed up playbook execution, when you are sure that most of the
configuration is already in the desired state.

Available role tags:

``role::kibana``
  Main role tag, should be used in the playbook to execute all of the role
  tasks as well as role dependencies.

``role::kibana:config``
  Generate the Kibana configuration taking into account different configuration
  sources.
