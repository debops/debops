Initial configuration
---------------------

By default the ``debops.debops`` role will install the DebOps playbooks and roles
from GitHub in the background, using either the ``batch`` command from the ``at``
package, or if the former is not available, ``async`` Ansible task. Keep in mind
that downloading all of the repositories might take a while and the code won't be
available for some time after initial Ansible playbook run.

If you cannot accept this behaviour you can set :envvar:`debops__update_method` to
``sync``. This will make the roles and playbooks immediately available after the
task is run. However, this will introduce a significant delay in every playbook
run even when no upstream changes will be found. You should only choose this if
you plan to run ``debops`` from the same playbook where you also include the
``debops.debops`` role, e.â€¯g. when provisioning a new DebOps environment.

Example inventory
-----------------

To install DebOps on a remote host, you need to add it to
``[debops_recursively]`` Ansible host group:

.. code-block:: none

    [debops_recursively]
    hostname

Example playbook
----------------

Here's an example playbook that installs DebOps support on a host:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../ansible/playbooks/service/debops.yml
   :language: yaml

The playbooks is shipped with this role under
:file:`docs/playbooks/debops.yml` from which you can symlink it to your
playbook directory.

Ansible tags
------------

You can use Ansible ``--tags`` or ``--skip-tags`` parameters to limit what
tasks are performed during Ansible run. This can be used after a host was first
configured to speed up playbook execution, when you are sure that most of the
configuration is already in the desired state.

Available role tags:

``role::debops``
  Main role tag, should be used in the playbook to execute all of the role
  tasks.
