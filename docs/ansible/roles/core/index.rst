debops.core
===========

The ``debops.core`` Ansible role takes care of variables that are shared among
different roles and are useful to keep in a central location. This is done by
leveraging functionality of `Ansible local facts`_ stored on remote hosts to
ensure that the variables are always evaluated by Ansible, even when playbook
is run with or without different sets of role tags.
