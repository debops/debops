Postfix configuration guides
============================

Here you can find a few guides that can help you configure more advanced
Postfix features. Some of these can and are implemented as separate Ansible
roles, here you can see the configuration specific to ``debops.postfix`` role.

Configure Postfix as a Virtual User Mail System
-----------------------------------------------

This guide describes how to set up a virtual user mail system, i.e.
where the senders and recipients do not correspond to the Linux system users.

It requires a working LDAP infrastructure (See :ref:`debops.ldap` and
:ref:`debops.slapd`) in order to manage and authenticate the users and get
the corresponding email address and aliases.
It is also possible to configure accounts with `wildcard` (catch-all)
email addresses. The default configuration uses first the aliases set by
:ref:`debops.etc_aliases` and then queries the LDAP server, if no match was found.

See also :ref:`debops.dovecot` and :ref:`debops.roundcube` for an IMAP server
and Email-Webclient correspondingly.

The following example shows a real-worldâ„¢ setup on the Hetzner Cloud. It consists of two servers,
one ``controller`` and a ``mail-server``. The LDAP directory is hosted also in the ``controller``.
``mail-server`` has access to LDAP over an internal network (10.10.10.0/28) attached directly to the VMs.
This setup has no internal DNS server (no split-DNS), thus internal IPs are mapped to DNS entries in the form ``$service.hetzner.mydomain.net``.
