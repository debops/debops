debops.environment
==================

The ``debops.environment`` role can be used to manage system-wide environment
variables, by default located in ``/etc/environment`` file. Variables are
gathered from multiple sources and combined to allow global/group/host tiered
environment modeled after Ansible inventory.

This role can also be used by other Ansible roles as a dependency to create
global environment variables in a safe way, that preserves idempotency.
