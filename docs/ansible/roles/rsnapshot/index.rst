debops.rsnapshot
================

The `rsnapshot`__ script is a wrapper around the `rsync`__ command that allows
creation and management of snapshotted backups of local or remote filesystems.
Periodic snapshots are created using :command:`cron` jobs and use `hard
links`__ to perform deduplication.

The ``debops.rsnapshot`` Ansible role acts as another "layer" above
:command:`rsnapshot`. The role can configure snapshotted backups of the local
host to internal or removable storage, as well as create snapshotted backups of
remote hosts over SSH.
