Default variable details
========================

Some of the ``debops.sssd`` default variables have more extensive
configuration than simple strings or lists, here you can find documentation and
examples for them.


.. _sssd__ref_configuration:

sssd__configuration
--------------------

The ``sssd__*_configuration`` variables define the contents of the
:file:`/etc/sssd/sssd..conf` configuration file. The variables are merged in
the order defined by the :envvar:`sssd__combined_configuration` variable, which
allows modification of the default configuration through the Ansible inventory.
See :man:`sssd.conf(5)` and the service-specific man pages (e.g.
:man:`sssd-ldap(5)`, :man:`sssd-krb5(5)` or :man:`sssd-sudo(5)`) for possible
configuration parameters and their values.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

See :envvar:`sssd__default_configuration` variable for an example of
existing configuration.

Enable debugging for the ``nss`` and ``pam`` subsystems:

.. code-block:: yaml

   sssd__configuration:

     - name: 'debug_level'
       value: '0x0770'
       section: 'nss'

     - name: 'debug_level'
       value: '0x0770'
       section: 'pam'


Enable enumeration (which means that ``sssd`` will download and cache all
users and groups from the LDAP server preemptively). This means that users
and groups will still be available in case of network outages, etc, but
enumeration is not suitable for large environments:

.. code-block:: yaml

   sssd__configuration:

     - name: 'enumerate'
       value: 'true'
       section: 'domain/default'


Syntax
~~~~~~

The variables contain a list of YAML dictionaries, each dictionary can have
the following parameters:

``section``
  Required. Name of the :man:`sssd.conf(5)` configuration section in which
  a given configuration option should be included. The sections are defined
  using the :ref:`sssd__ref_configuration_sections` variables; the default
  sections available are: ``sssd``, ``nss``, ``pam``, ``sudo``, ``ssh`` and
  ``domain/default``.

``name``
  Required. The name of a given :man:`sssd.conf(5)` configuration option
  for a given ``section``. Options with the same ``section`` and ``name``
  will be merged in order of appearance.

``value``
  Required. The value of a given configuration option. It can be either
  a string, or a YAML list (elements will be joined with spaces).

``raw``
  Optional. String or YAML text block which will be included in the
  configuration file "as is". If this parameter is specified, the ``name``
  and ``value`` parameters are ignored - you need to specify the
  entire line(s) with configuration option names as well.

``state``
  Optional. If not defined or ``present``, a given configuration option or
  section will be included in the generated configuration file. If ``absent``,
  ``ignore`` or ``init``, a given configuration option or section will not be
  included in the generated file. If ``comment``, the option will be included
  but commented out and inactive.

``comment``
  Optional. String or YAML text block that contains comments about a given
  configuration option.


.. _sssd__ref_configuration_sections:

sssd__configuration_sections
----------------------------

The ``sssd__*_configuration_sections`` variables define which sections are
present in the :file:`/etc/sssd/sssd.conf` configuration file. Sections
will be included in the file in the order in which they are defined in the
configuration variables.

The default set of configuration sections, defined in the
:envvar:`sssd__default_configuration_sections` variable, is based on
the sections listed in the :manpage:`sssd.conf(5)` manual page.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Define a section with a custom title:

.. code-block:: yaml

   sssd__configuration_sections:

     - name: 'domain/work'
       title: 'Additional LDAP domain'

Syntax
~~~~~~

The variables contain a list of YAML dictionaries, each dictionary can have
the following parameters:

``name``
  Required. The name of the section to add to :file:`/etc/sssd/sssd.conf`.
  Multiple entries with the same ``name`` parameter are merged together.

``title``
  Optional. This parameter can be used to provide a short description
  of the section which will be included in the generated configuration file.

``state``
  Optional. If not specified or ``present``, a given section will be included
  in the generated configuration file. If ``absent``, the section will not be
  included in the file. If ``ignore``, a given configuration entry will not be
  evaluated during role execution. If ``hidden``, the section's header and title
  will be hidden in the generated configuration file.

``weight``
  Optional. A positive or negative number which can be used to affect the order
  of sections in the generated configuration file. Positive numbers add more
  "weight" to the section making it appear "lower" in the file; negative
  numbers substract the "weight" and therefore move the section upper in the
  file.
