Description
===========

`docker-gen`_ generates configuration files for host services to make the
Dockerized services accessible to them.
For example this role can create the required configuration
for publishing a Dockerized web-service via the host's web-server.
The configuration is
based on available Docker container metadata.

This role creates a service and configuration to generate :program:`nginx` upstream
service definitions, which can be used by ``debops.nginx`` role to configure
Dockerized services, either local or remote, behind an :program:`nginx` reverse proxy.
Other services and templates might be provided in the future.
