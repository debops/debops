debops.resolvconf
=================

The :file:`/etc/resolv.conf` configuration file defines the system-wide DNS
resolver configuration. It is a central location to configure the DNS
nameservers, search domains and other options. In modern Linux systems, many
services might want to change that configuration file to enable their
functionality - `NetworkManager`__, ``ifupdown``, `dnsmasq`__, ``unbound``
being several examples of that.

To avoid clashes between various software packages modifying the
:file:`/etc/resolv.conf` file, the ``resolvconf`` package provides a stable API
to the :file:`/etc/resolv.conf` that combines information from other services
and creates a consistent resolver configuration.

The ``debops.resolvconf`` Ansible role further updates the ``resolvconf``
configuration to fix issues with outdated defaults on modern Debian/Ubuntu
hosts. By default the role will update the interface order list to include the
`Predictable Network Interface Names`__ as well as clarify the order of the
NetworkManager interfaces. The role will also automatically rearrange the
configuration of VPN tunnels if a local DNS resolver is detected.

Contrary to its name, the ``debops.resolvconf`` role does not configure the
:file:`/etc/resolv.conf` file directly. You should consult the documentation of
various DNS-related services to see how you can modify the contents of this
file through them.
