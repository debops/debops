Support for different PHP versions
----------------------------------

The ``debops.php`` role supports management of multiple PHP versions; only one
PHP version can be managed at a time. By default the role will install and
configure the PHP version provided with the current OS release.

The role checks for existence of various PHP APT packages and chooses a version
based the order in :envvar:`php__version_preference`.  To force an older
version in case the newer one is installed, you can change the order of the
packages used for the version detection using the
:envvar:`php__version_preference` list.

To learn how to specify different PHP packages for installation, refer to
:ref:`php__ref_packages` documentation.

PHP packages provided by Ondřej Surý
------------------------------------

`Ondřej Surý <https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=ondrej%40debian.org>`_
is a member of the Debian PHP Maintainers team and maintains Debian PHP
packages. He also provides `an external APT package repository
<https://deb.sury.org/>`_ of various PHP versions for Debian and Ubuntu
distributions.

The ``debops.php`` role can use the packages from the Ondřej Surý repositories
to provide alternative PHP versions. Remember that these packages **DO NOT**
fall under the Debian Stable security support and may contain bugs.

To enable the custom APT repository, add in the Ansible inventory:

.. code-block:: yaml

   php__sury: True

This will add the required OpenPGP keys and APT repositories.


Custom environment role
-----------------------

The ``debops.php`` provides a small, custom role ``debops.php/env`` which
should be added to the playbook or role dependencies before the main role and
other roles that use configuration from ``debops.php``, like
:ref:`debops.logrotate`. The ``debops.php/env`` role configures custom APT
repositories if they are enabled and prepares the facts needed by other roles
to function correctly. See the
:ref:`provided playbook<php__ref_example_playbook>` for an example usage.


PHP Composer installation
-------------------------

The :ref:`debops.php` role will install the `PHP Composer`__, a dependency
manager for PHP. The version from the OS repositories will be preferred. On
older OS releases, a known upstream binary will be downloaded and installed
instead.

Layout of the php.ini configuration
-----------------------------------

The main :file:`/etc/php<version>/*/php.ini` files maintained by the OS
distribution are not modified by the ``debops.php`` role to allow an easy
upgrade process.  Instead, a custom :file:`php.ini` configuration is stored in
:file:`/etc/php<bersion>/ansible/*.ini` files generated using a simple
template, which is then linked to each of the PHP SAPI directories in
:file:`/etc/php<version>/*/conf.d/` which are read by the PHP interpreters.
This allows for configuration synchronization between different PHP
interpreters. To learn more about this process refer to
:ref:`php__ref_configuration` documentation.


Information stored in Ansible local facts
-----------------------------------------

The PHP version configured on a host is available for other Ansible roles
through the Ansible local facts. The specific variables are:

``ansible_local.php.version``
  Short version of the PHP environment, used in package names.
  For example, ``5`` or ``7.0``.

``ansible_local.php.long_version``
  Longer version of the PHP environment, used for version comparison. For
  example, ``5.6.22`` or ``7.0.8``. This variable might be inaccurate in case
  of the minor or major version upgrade.

The Ansible local facts are used by the ``debops.php`` role to ensure
idempotent operation. In case that you want to upgrade a host to a newer PHP
release without uninstalling the older one, you can set :envvar:`php__reset` to
``True``, so that the role can re-detect the available PHP versions.
After one role run, you should set :envvar:`php__reset` back to its default
value.

Example inventory
-----------------

To enable management of a PHP environment on a host, you need to include that
host in the ``[debops_service_php]`` Ansible inventory group::

  [debops_service_php]
  hostname

The default configuration included in the role will install the base PHP
``cli`` and ``fpm`` packages and create a PHP-FPM pool meant to be used by the
``www-data`` user which is a common user account used to serve PHP applications
packaged on Debian systems. To deploy your own applications you should consider
creating a custom system account and a corresponding PHP-FPM pool to securely
separate it from other applications. To learn how to do that, refer to the
:ref:`php__ref_pools` documentation.


.. _php__ref_example_playbook:

Example playbook
----------------

If you are using this role without DebOps, here's an example Ansible playbook
that uses the ``debops.php`` role:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../ansible/playbooks/service/php.yml
   :language: yaml
   :lines: 1,6-


Ansible tags
------------

You can use Ansible ``--tags`` or ``--skip-tags`` parameters to limit what
tasks are performed during Ansible run. This can be used after a host was first
configured to speed up playbook execution, when you are sure that most of the
configuration is already in the desired state.

Available role tags:

``role::php``
  Main role tag, should be used in the playbook to execute all tasks.

``role::php:config``
  Generate the PHP and PHP-FPM configuration.

``role::php:pools``
  Generate only PHP-FPM pool configuration.
