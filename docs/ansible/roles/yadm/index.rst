debops.yadm
===========

`Yet Another Dotfiles Manager`__ (:command:`yadm`) is a wrapper script around
the :command:`git` command that manages `dotfiles`__ located in the ``$HOME``
directory using a :command:`git` repository. yadm supports encrypted storage
for sensitive files, alternative file selection based on host
class/OS/hostname/user account, bootstrap script and Jinja templating.

The ``debops.yadm`` Ansible role will install the :command:`yadm` script,
either from an APT repository, or using the upstream :command:`git` repository.
The role will also install a ``zsh`` shell and a few essential CLI
applications.

Optionally, ``debops.yadm`` role can clone selected dotfiles :command:`git`
repositories to the host creating mirrors, that can be used by users or other
Ansible roles to deploy dotfiles locally.
