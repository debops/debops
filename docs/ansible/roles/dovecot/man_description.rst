Description
===========

The :command:`dovecot` daemon, maintained by the `Dovecot Project`__, is a
modern IMAP and POP3 email server for Linux/UNIX-like systems, written with
security primarily in mind. Dovecot is an excellent choice for both small and
large installations. Itâ€™s fast, simple to set up, requires no special
administration and it uses very little memory.

The ``debops.dovecot`` Ansible role can be used to configure the
:command:`dovecot` service on a host and to automatically setup
various auxiliary roles, such as :ref:`debops.pki` for SSL/TLS encryption.
