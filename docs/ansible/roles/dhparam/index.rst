debops.dhparam
==============

`Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange`_ is a way to securely share encryption keys
publicly between two parties. It's used in TLS and SSL connections to provide
`Perfect Forward Secrecy`_. Unfortunately, the default DH parameters distributed
with applications are susceptible to a `downgrade attack`_.

The ``debops.dhparam`` Ansible role will generate a set of strong
Diffie-Hellman parameters on the Ansible Controller, which will be preseeded on
remote hosts, and will be ready to use by other applications. A separate script
can then be used on remote hosts in the background to generate new random DH
parameters, either once or in regular intervals.
