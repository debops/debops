============

`WP-CLI`__ framework is a PHP script which can be used to manage `WordPress`__

Admin dashboard, provides an interface for :command:`cron` task execution for
a given WordPress website, create backups, and lots of other things.

The ``debops.wpcli`` Ansible role can be used to install WP-CLI on a host
managed by DebOps, which in turn enables management of per-user WordPress
websites. The role is designed with shared hosting environment in mind; users
need to utilize other DebOps/Ansible roles to manage the :ref:`webserver
<debops.nginx>`, :ref:`database engine <debops.mariadb_server>`, :ref:`PHP
environment <debops.php>` and :ref:`UNIX accounts <debops.users>`, etc.
