Custom LDAP schemas
===================

The ``debops.slapd`` role by default configures a set of custom LDAP schemas on
top of the default ones enabled during :command:`slapd` installation. The
schemas included in a LDAP directory cannot be removed without issues,
therefore it's best to select the ones you want to use at the database
initialization.

You can find more details about managing the LDAP schemas using ``cn=config``
configuration `in the Zytrax LDAP guide`__.

General notes
-------------

The ``slapd__*_schemas`` variables define a list of LDAP schemas to import by
the role. The list is not merged via custom Ansible filter plugins and is only
additive. You can define different sets of schemas on different Ansible
inventory levels.

The schema files need to already be present on the remote host to be imported
by the role. The default schemas included by the role are installed via APT
packages, you can see the available set of schemas by running the command:

.. code-block:: console

   apt-cache search fusiondirectory plugin schema

The Debian/Ubuntu archive also contains a smaller set of APT packages for the
GOsa² application which contain LDAP schemas, however the ``gosa-*`` and
``fusiondirectory-*`` packages conflict with each other.

You can use the :ref:`debops.resources` role to copy custom ``*.schema`` or
``*.ldif`` files to the remote host before importing them. The ``*.ldif`` files
can be imported automatically, but the ``*.schema`` import relies on the
:command:`fusiondirectory-insert-schema` command which is available in the
``fusiondirectory-schema`` APT package.

If you are using clustered OpenLDAP, for example in N-Way Multi Master
replication mode, you should import the schemas only on one node at a time.
Execution of the import command on multiple remote hosts at once will result in
an error when one replication host already has a schema defined with a specific
``X-ORDERED`` index number, but the other nodes don't. The schema will be
replicated automatically between all of the OpenLDAP masters.


.. _slapd__ref_rfc2307bis:

The ``rfc2307bis`` schema
-------------------------

The `rfc2307bis LDAP schema`__ is a proposed replacement of the :rfc:`2307`
document that defines the ``nis`` LDAP schema. Main improvement over the old
``nis`` schema is the modified ``posixGroup`` LDAP object, which in the new
schema has an ``AUXILIARY`` type instead of the ``STRUCTURAL`` type. Notably,
the ``posixAccount`` LDAP object has an ``AUXILIARY`` type in the original
``nis`` scheme; the change makes both objects work similarly by allowing an
UNIX-based attributes to be combined with LDAP-based directory entries.

Without this change, LDAP directories that are used in UNIX-like environments
for group authentication require two sets of groups stored in the directory
- one for LDAP entities based on DN attributes, and another for UNIX entities
based on GID attributes. The new schema enables the ``posixGroup`` object
type to combine with other LDAP object types, namely ``groupOfNames`` or
``groupOfUniqueNames``. This allows the two sets of data to be combined in
one object - allowing both the UID and DN attributes to be used as group
members.  This of course depends on the client-side support - both
:command:`nslcd` and :command:`sssd` daemons should be able to use the combined
data sets correctly.

Support in Debian
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some of the Linux-based distributions provide the :command:`slapd` package with
the new ``rfc2307bis`` schema enabled by default. Unfortunately, Debian's
:command:`slapd` APT package includes the original ``nis`` schema which
conflicts with the new ``rfc2307bis`` schema because both define the same LDAP
objects and their attributes. The ``nis`` schema is loaded by default during
the :command:`slapd` package installation and removing it from the already
initialized directory can be difficult.

Fortunately, there's a clean way to avoid this issue and enable the
``rfc2307bis`` schema on :command:`slapd` installation. The Debian Archive
contains two packages that provide it: `fusiondirectory-schema`__ and
`gosa-schema`__. Both packages conflict with each other, therefore only one can
be installed at a time. In the ``debops.slapd`` role, the
``fusiondirectory-schema`` has been selected because FusionDirectory project
seems to be an actively maintained fork of GOsa² and will be more likely to be
selected for installation; another reason is more
``fusiondirectory-plugin-*-schema`` APT packages available in Debian.

The role still works fine with ``gosa-schema`` APT package installed, however
this will not be detected automatically; the user should redefine the
:envvar:`slapd__rfc2307bis_packages` list the Ansible inventory to select this
APT package.

.. __: https://packages.debian.org/stable/fusiondirectory-schema
.. __: https://packages.debian.org/stable/gosa-schema

Before the installation of the :command:`slapd` APT package, the
``debops.slapd`` role will install the ``fusiondirectory-schema`` package,
divert the :file:`/etc/ldap/schema/nis.(ldif,schema)` files aside using the
:command:`dpkg-divert` tool and create a symlink to the
:file:`/etc/ldap/fusiondirectory/rfc2307bis.(ldif,schema)` files in their
place. With this modification, when the :command:`slapd` APT package is
installed, it will automatically include the modified ``rfc2307bis`` schema.

The automatic installation of the ``rfc2307bis`` schema can be disabled by
setting the :envvar:`slapd__rfc2307bis_enabled` boolean variable to ``False``.
This allows usage of the LDAP directories that use the old ``nis`` schema
without modifications to the directory contents.


.. _slapd__ref_initial_schemas:

The initial LDAP schemas
------------------------

During installation of the ``slapd`` Debian package, the postinstall script
creates a new OpenLDAP configuration using the
:file:`/usr/share/slapd/slapd.init.ldif` LDIF configuration file. The default
LDAP schemas imported at that time are:

- ``core.schema``
- ``cosine.schema``
- ``nis.schema`` (replaced by the ``rfc2307bis.schema`` before installation)
- ``inetorgperson.schema``

You can find the schema files in the :file:`/etc/ldap/schema/` directory on the
OpenLDAP server host.


.. _slapd__ref_posixgroupid:

The ``posixgroupid`` schema
---------------------------

This is a custom LDAP schema maintained by DebOps. It can be found in the
:file:`ansible/roles/debops.slapd/files/etc/ldap/schema/debops/` directory of
the DebOps monorepo.

The ``rfc2307bis`` schema fixes one issue with POSIX groups in LDAP - the
``posixGroup`` object attributes can be added to any object type. But there's
one other problem not fixed by this schema - the name of the group is taken
from the ``cn`` attribute. This causes an issue when LDAP group names are in
a human-readable form, instead of a short string form preferred in POSIX
environments, for example: ``UNIX Administrators`` vs ``admins``.

Another issue shows up with different `User Private Group`__ implementations in
LDAP - because the ``cn`` attribute in the LDAP objects that define people is
used for the person's full name, for example "John Smith", personal UNIX groups
cannot be defined in the same LDAP object, even though the ``gidNumber``
attribute is required by the ``posixAccount`` object type.

.. __: https://wiki.debian.org/UserPrivateGroups

There are different solutions to this problem - create a separate
``posixGroup`` object for each person and put it either in a separate directory
subtree, or as a child entry of the person's object, but these solutions are
cumbersome and require hard to implement ACL rules. A different solution is
adding a new attribute that would define the UNIX group name separate from the
common name.

This is what the :file:`posixgroupid.schema` LDAP schema does - it adds the
``gid`` or ``groupid`` attribute, either in a separate ``gidObject`` object
type, or in the ``posixGroupId`` object which is a subclass of the
``posixGroup`` object. With the ``gid`` attribute, LDAP clients that are
configured to use it, can use a different LDAP attribute as the UNIX group name
instead of the human-readable ``cn`` name. Similarly, LDAP objects that
represent people can have a ``gid`` attribute that contains the name of the
Private User Group, usually the same as the ``uid`` attribute. This requires
that the LDAP clients look for the ``gid`` attribute instead of the ``cn``
attribute as the UNIX group name, but it's usually a simple configuration
change.


.. _slapd__ref_ppolicy_schema:

The ``ppolicy`` schema
----------------------

The ``ppolicy`` schema provides LDAP object and attribute definitions required
by the :ref:`slapd__ref_ppolicy_overlay`.


.. _slapd__ref_ldapns:

The ``ldapns`` schema
---------------------

The ``ldapns`` schema provides a set of LDAP objects and attributes that can be
used for granular access control to services and hosts that use the LDAP
directory. The ``host`` attribute can be used to define a list of FQDN names,
or hostnames to which a given user or application has access. The
``authorizedService`` attribute can contain a list of services accessible to an
user or application. LDAP clients can use these attributes in LDAP filters to
grant access only to specific people or applications.


.. _slapd__ref_openssh_lpk:

The ``openssh-lpk`` schema
--------------------------

The ``openssh-lpk`` schema allows the LDAP directory to hold SSH public keys,
which combined with OpenSSH ``AuthorizedKeysCommand`` configuration can allow
SSH authentication via LDAP directory. An `example openssh-ldap-publickey`__
script shows how this can be configured with OpenSSH and OpenLDAP.

.. __: https://github.com/AndriiGrytsenko/openssh-ldap-publickey

The :ref:`debops.sshd` Ansible role already contains support for SSH public key
lookup in OpenLDAP, see its documentation for more details about enabling the
support.

.. _slapd__ref_sudo:

The ``sudo`` schema
-------------------

The `sudo`__ service can be configured to `use LDAP directory as a backend`__
for its rules. The :ref:`debops.sudo` Ansible role will enable the LDAP support
when the :ref:`debops.ldap` configuration is detected (not implemented yet).

.. __: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo
.. __: https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.8.17/sudoers.ldap.man.html

The rules in the LDAP directory are meant to be used with LDAP-based users and
groups; local accounts should still rely on local :file:`/etc/sudoers` contents
to ensure service availability in case of an issue with connection to the LDAP
service.

Manual pages: :man:`sudoers.ldap(5)`

.. _slapd__ref_eduperson:

The ``eduPerson`` schema
------------------------

The ``eduPerson`` and ``eduOrg`` are Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP) schema designed to include widely-used person and organizational
attributes in higher education. The ``eduPerson`` object class provides
a common list of attributes and definitions, drawing on the existing standards
in higher education. The schema were developed `by the Internet2 project`__ and
are commonly used in academic institutions.

.. __: https://www.internet2.edu/products-services/trust-identity/eduperson-eduorg/

The schema is available in Debian in the
``fusiondirectory-plugin-supann-schema`` APT package, however that version is
slightly outdated and does not include object and attribute descriptions.
Because of that, DebOps contains its own copy of the schema, cleaned up and
updated, which will be imported by default to OpenLDAP directory server.


.. _slapd__ref_nextcloud:

The ``nextcloud`` schema
------------------------

The ``nextcloud`` schema provides a set of LDAP objectClasses and attributes
that can be used to control LDAP integration with :ref:`Nextcloud
<debops.owncloud>` application. Using these attributes, administrators can
define disk quotas for Nextcloud users stored in the LDAP directory, as well as
define which user groups present in LDAP are available in the Nextcloud user
interface.
