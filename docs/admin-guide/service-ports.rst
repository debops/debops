Custom services and their default ports
=======================================

In various DebOps roles you can find named ports. They are defined in
:file:`/etc/services` using debops.etc_services_ role which manages them using
Ansible's ``assemble`` module. To avoid collisions between various services we
list here custom ports that are set for applications and services that don't
have specified system ports by default.

You can find a list of ports used throughout the DebOps project by running
command::

    debops-defaults | grep '_port:'

This should output list of all variables that define port numbers in various
roles and are available in role defaults, and thus can be overridden by Ansible
inventory.
