Default variables: configuration
================================

Some of ``debops.cryptsetup`` variables have more extensive configuration.
Here you can find documentation and examples for them.

cryptsetup_devices
------------------

Note the following list only documents the common parameters. The role allows
you to use more specific parameters which are not documented below.

``name``
  Required, string. Name of the plaintext device mapper target and the mount point.
  Must be unique among all device mapper targets and should not be changed once
  it was used.

``ciphertext_block_device``
  Required, string. File path to the ciphertext block device, either the block
  device itself e.g. :file:`/dev/sdb` or a partition on the block device e.g.
  :file:`/dev/sdb5`.

``crypttab_options``
  Optional, string. List of options to configure for each device in
  :file:`/etc/crypttab`.
  Overwrites the default as configured by ``cryptsetup_crypttab_options``
  variable.

``keyfile``
  Optional, string. File path for the keyfile on the Ansible controller. Will
  be copied over to the remote system. If it does not exist yet it will be
  generated from :file:`/dev/random` on the Ansible controller as it is
  expected that the entropy pool on the Ansible controller is better mixed.
  Defaults to:

  .. code:: jinja

    {{ cryptsetup_keyfile_location + "/" + item.name + "/keyfile.raw" }}

``backup_header``
  Optional, string. Disable backing up the `LUKS`_ header to the Ansible
  controller for this item.
  See ``cryptsetup_keyfile_location`` variable.

``fstype``
  Optional, string. Filesystem type to create on the plaintext device mapper
  target.
  Defaults to ``cryptsetup_fstype`` variable.

``mount``
  Optional, string. Plaintext mount point of the filesystem.
  Defaults to:

  .. code:: jinja

    {{ cryptsetup_mountpoint_parent_directory + "/" + item.name }}

``mount_options``
  Optional, string. Mount options associated with the filesystem.
  For more details see :manpage:`mount(8)`.

``state``
  Optional, string. There are four states which can be chosen for each
  encrypted filesystem.  If no state is given, the value of
  ``cryptsetup_state`` will be used which defaults to ``mounted``.

  ``mounted``
    Ensure that the encryption and filesystem layer are in place on the block device and
    the filesystem is mounted.

  ``unmounted``
    Ensure that the encryption and filesystem layer are in place on the block device and
    the filesystem is unmounted. Additionally ensures that the cryptsetup mapping
    is removed so that no direct access to the plain-text block device is possible.

  ``present``
    Ensure that the encryption and filesystem layer are in place on the block device.
    The plaintext device mapper target will be created as needed during the
    Ansible run to ensure the filesystem on it is present. When it was not
    available prior to this Ansible run, it will be stopped at the end of the
    role run again.
    So basically, this option never changes the mounted/unmounted state of the
    plaintext device mapper target or the plaintext mount point of the
    filesystem.
    Note that this option will not fail when the ciphertext block device is not
    available during the Ansible run and the keyfile has not been generated by Ansible.
    This was done to allow to provision remote systems with keys for ciphertext block
    devices which have been setup previously and are not available during
    execution of this role.

  ``absent``
    Same as ``unmounted`` but additionally removes all configuration, the
    keyfile and the header backup from the remote system for this item.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Create an encrypted LUKS device using an existing partition. Device will be
mounted at ``/media/crypt0`` and will be automatically mounted at boot:

.. code:: yaml

    cryptsetup_devices:
      - name: 'crypt0'
        ciphertext_block_device: '/dev/sdb1'
