The [rsyslog](http://rsyslog.com/) package is used to read, process, store
and forward system logs in different ways, on local or remote systems. The
`debops.rsyslog` role can be used to easily configure log forwarding to
a central log server, as well as store logs on the filesystem or other storage
backends.

### Installation

This role requires at least Ansible `v2.0.0`. To install it, run:

```Shell
