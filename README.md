  [![Ansible Galaxy](http://img.shields.io/badge/galaxy-debops.cryptsetup-660198.svg?style=flat)](https://galaxy.ansible.com/detail#/role/4559)

This role allows you to configure a encrypted filesystem on top of any given
block device using [dm-crypt][]/[cryptsetup][] and [LUKS][].  A random keyfile generated on the Ansible
controller will be used for the encryption by default.  It is your
responsibility that the keyfile is kept secure for this to make sense.  For
example by storing the keyfile on a already encrypted filesystem (both on
the Ansible controller and the remote system).

### Features

* Create a random keyfile or use an already existing file.
* Manage `/etc/crypttab` and `/etc/fstab`.
