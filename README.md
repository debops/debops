The `debops.redis` role allows you to easily setup infrastructure capable of
running and managing 1 or more Redis servers. It is completely self healing
with Redis Sentinel and supports replication seamlessly.

Few features available in this role:

- seamless master/slave replication;
- throw together a master + n slaves + n sentinel setup in about 10 lines of YAML
  (most of those lines would be adding your hosts to the inventory);
- your configs are idempotent, even when redis rewrites them;
- pretty much every redis config value is tweakable;
- you can easily use this role as a dependency in your other roles;

### Installation

This role requires at least Ansible `v1.7.0`. To install it, run:
