This role will bootstrap and manage fully-fledged Public Key Infrastructure
entirely within Ansible. You can create Certificate Authorities
(stand-alone as well as chained together) which in turn can automatically
sign incoming Certificate Requests and provide you with fully-functional
OpenSSL or GnuTLS certificates for your entire infrastructure, for free.

`debops.pki` can also be used to easily distribute private keys and
certificates signed by an external CA to your hosts in an easy and
convenient way. Role will automatically create a set of symlinks to make
use of the certificates within your applications easy and intuitive.

### Installation

This role requires at least Ansible `v1.7.0`. To install it, run:

    ansible-galaxy install debops.pki

### Documentation

More information about `debops.pki` can be found in the
[official debops.pki documentation](http://docs.debops.org/en/latest/ansible/roles/debops.pki.html).


### Role dependencies

### Are you using this as a standalone role without DebOps?

You may need to include missing roles from the [DebOps common
playbook](https://github.com/debops/debops-playbooks/blob/master/playbooks/common.yml)
into your playbook.
